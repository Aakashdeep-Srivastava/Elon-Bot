I would say from the age of three I thought he was a genius he would reason with me and he his reasoning was sensible and how do you even do that when you don't really have much experience my name is Errol Graham musk I'm elon's father my my relationship with Elon is very much the same as my relationship I had with my father we mostly communicate on email I haven't spoken to them for quite a long time a roller coaster ride in terms of watching Elon go through the trials and tribulations of of working and the toll that that's um you know it takes on a relationship you know and and you accept that when you're you know spending time with him you're getting a very small part of him because 95% of his mental energy is still being consumed by these problems he doesn't get any breaks from it I wanted him to go to Nursery School they said well he makes it by 2 days but you really should keep him back a year because otherwise he'll be a little socially challenged and I said you don't understand I have a genius son he needs to talk to someone besides me and of course they roll their eyes because every mother thinks their child is a genius as a teenager Elon didn't have many friends but um he read all the time through the night I couldn't get him up in the morning he read a lot of Science Fiction he would read through the night until he saw me get getting up and then he would go to sleep and then of course had to dress him while he was half asleep and get him to school he compartmentalizes his brain people are coming in and talking to him and every hour they tell him what's happening and when you date or marry Elon you don't see him much so it is hard to have a relationship in in his case we were uh seeing a marital therapist and I think he just got tired of the stress and the uncertainty of it and the next day sorry I went into my therapist's office and um he had left a message for her to tell me that um he was filing for divorce so that was um that was how I found out one of the more uh memorable moments of my life yeah my first impressions were that he was very sweet he seemed quite shy he said may I put my hand on your knee and I said okay go on then it was quite sweet that he asked you know he said I don't usually do this but you know um I'd love to see you tomorrow can can we meet for breakfast and we had breakfast and then at the end of breakfast he said will you come and have lunch with me so then we went for lunch and then he said will you come to dinner and then I remember one evening he said um would would you like to come back to my hotel room so we can look at Rocket videos I thought I was like okay yeah I'll I'll come back back and um and we did get into his hotel room and he did just show me rocket videos I mean I was very young when I met Elon I was 22 so I hadn't really um yeah that was it school and a bit of acting and then I felt pregnant on honeymoon then and the abuse started right away beating me up if I didn't do as I was told I came back from honeymoon bruised and Pregnant and then I didn't want my family to know so then you just put up with that because you have no choice Elon while he was a little boy he grew up in a very violent home like for example when I always had to drive the car and he would be punching me and Elon would be between the seats hitting his father to stop him punching me when he would be at home and punching me Kimble and tsco would be crying in the corner because they were really babies they Elon was five Kimble four TSA 3 Elon would be hitting his dad at the back of his legs and then when he was eight we left my father has serious issues um okay well so you didn't have a happy childhood it was very violent Elon said he wanted to go and live with his father and that made me very sad very sad because I didn't see why he would wanted to do that his father had the encyclopedia britanica I couldn't afford books I mean he'd read everything in the library in Durban so he had the opportunity to actually read the whole encyclopedias I could call him anytime and ask him any subject anything in the world I do know that you were bullied at school and had a almost been to death if you've call that bullied he was shy and awkward at school Elon didn't have many friends I remember thinking wow what an incredible man never met anyone like him and I was just thinking about him and so I emailed him and said okay well I've got some time after this shoot so I'm going to book a flight to LA and I've I've never been to La I'll book myself a holiday and it would be lovely to see and he wanted to sort of you know fly me over and sort it all out and I was like no it's fine I'll I'll take care of it and then he said I don't want you to go home and I want to marry you and he apologized he said I'm sorry I don't have a a ring he said but this is you know this is what I'd like to do and so we shook hands on it and I said yes I will do my father told my mother at the end of their first date that he was going to marry her and so I think I was primed to think that after 10 day you know I thought yep that's that's how it happens that's what love is and do that thing dad you know obviously moved straight into the house with the children and it became a very real thing thing immediately he was trying to avoid bankruptcy every day El would come home and say tomorrow that's it being ridiculed in the Press horrible things being said there was something called the Tesla Death Watch at the time which was an Internet site kind of counting down the days till when Tesla was going to disappear electric car maker Tesla laying off 20% of the workforce 24% he'd have night terrors in the middle of the night I'd be fast to sleep and then suddenly he would be screaming in his sleep and of trying to climb up like in his sleep trying to escape something all available resource had to be plowed into the the projects into the companies you know he gave me an out he said this this is going to be the hard path and you don't have to stay for it it was really awful he plowed his money into Tesla and SpaceX he was under incredible stress I was worried he was going to have a heart attack I just kept thinking God I've just got to keep this guy alive and even when I'm with him I don't see him much unless I sit in the back of the meetings uh but then a wife or girlfriend doesn't have that and so they really don't see him much at all getting knocked about was pretty normal uh I mean if you did well in at school you you would they would wait for you at the uh exit of the school and and and Pummel you with their bags so I mean if you call that bullying we had a lot of that Elon was a good reader very early on so Elon was very keen on reading about Napoleon about Alexander the Great and he would he would he he even had a copy of Napoleon's last Willen testament which is in French people would say to him are you reading are you reading that big thick book little boy some idiot would say to him and uh and and Elon would say what are you stupid you think I'm just looking at the pictures or what you know so so you know but um he liked to with the adults in company so if the other kids were running around playing he would like to sit with the adults where often he was often told why don't you go and play with the children and he'd say no I'd rather sit here with the adults it was one of the bad Christmases he'd forgotten to get me a Christmas present we were in Boulder Colorado so it's loads and loads of snow and we were in bed and he said I do you know he's not that I don't love you I do really really love you he's just it's like you know my is exploding and I was like no I know it's fine and and he sort of got up in the middle of the night and disappeared I was like where's where is he gone and he came back 2 hours later and he'd gone outside in his t-shirt and shorts Barefoot and he'd gone and like dug through the snow and picked flowers from like he'd walked all over Boulder and like came back with a little bouquet of of of picked flowers and he was I I just wanted to show you how much I loved you I'm happy to say that SpaceX and Tesla are in the hands of my brilliant Son Well genius son we admire him for that we don't want to be him because with those companies he gets a lot of hate stop being mean to him I hate it when the media are mean to him he was very supportive of me having a career but I had to come back and do something Tres too and was the first time we'd been apart and he he sent two Lor loads of flowers to set for me and he'd also found out from production the the name of every woman on set and he'd sent them all flowers and champagne and chocolate so that then when he came to visit everyone was like oh hi on the C here I remember at the premiere he came along and he was holding my umbrella for me while I was doing some signings no one knew who Elon was [Applause] [Music] he was very sweet and lovely I mean it was a crazy crazy sort of upwards trajectory from nothing to everything it felt like being on a rocket um you know we were being invited places and I remember we were you know we were at a party and then actually at that dinner I think I sat next to Bill Clinton and Elon said the great thing about being famous is that when you sit next to somebody you don't know a dinner party they think the bad conversation is their fault because that is that is sort of what happens now everyone sort of listens to everything he says and I've I've had people say to me oh I met Elon and you know and he you know I could tell he was a genius because he seemed incredibly distracted and he was clearly thinking great things and I'd be thinking really you know you you probably just didn't like you or he probably a bit board and then I text Elon and be like just met so and so and he'd be like oh yeah really boring I had a lot of nice cars during elon's youth Porsche uh and Mer's Ferrari and um Maserati he was always interested in taking the doors apart and all that sort of stuff because sometimes you had to fix something and and he would he would do it he would open it up himself for me I wouldn't say he was the best mechanic you know uh most amateur mechanics are a little bit ham-handed but um but he he he was certainly try he was he was definitely not a boring child not a boring child I found I found LA really tough from the moment I landed there it was an incredible culture shock and um but I I just wanted to come home yeah and and I kept trying to come home but then also I do really love Elon as well and um so you know we it took took quite a few years of us figuring that out but I mean he I think he could kind of see the way the world was going in a way I just I just did not understand and I I love having that perspective and and um and I'm grateful for that that whole for every part of that I hope he gets Humanity to Mars because I think that is his reason for being more than any other once we sort of get our mind on something um we we tend to not stop you not so much you can't sleep but but you wake up you go to bed with it in your head you wake up with it in your head um you you you you you you focus on it entirely continually uh to the point that um you might forget to eat and and and and not ever you know you can't get the person to say look quit quit now quit now stop this you know it's a kind of uh passion or something that possesses you to just keep on trying keep on trying he's has a kind of Innocence to him what I mean by that is that he feels with Incredible Purity the emotion that he is feeling at the time whatever that emotion is he feels things very very deeply um so you know I've heard it said that he's cold and emotionless and that that could not be further from the truth he is the most emotional person I know one of the things I remember really early on is we were we gone to the cinema we watching some comedy and Elon found the film so funny that he literally fell on the floor and was like rolling around holding his Tommy laughing and everyone else in the cinema was looking at us like what the hell is going on over there and I was like come on get up off the floor but he was he was just enraptured by what was on screen and he was feeling it and he feels things and you know if he feels anger you know it it's there um you know anything he it's it's it goes deep he told me all about his childhood growing up I think his childhood shapes him in a lot of ways I think he knows what it's like to be bottom of the pack to be hurt by people that you should be able to trust and obviously I think that leaves scars and i' I've also learned and and I think a lot of people have learned if he says it's like it's he can do it he's probably you know that don't discount Elon don't say no to Elon you you know he's you're going to lose you're going to l
