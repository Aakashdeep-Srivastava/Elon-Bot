a catch that's his come C damer just ofc on that left tack Jack Nelson number that Drew theen third down to get back on the field [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that St defense job stand come get OPP return didn't give up a long return last week to Northwest that here today 52 y 1 Ys insurance by checking first the che first before taking off yeah cheing first is smart so check all state the new7 spots from Taco Bell with and the chicken chip only is the price the new $7 bu spr about [Music] how e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e it's like absentee ball like right there have an but you're here yes as as strange as that sounds you can literally go in request an abente valet and even though you're right there you can hand it in and wait and and I think maybe some some County offices are open on weekend but they're definitely open on Monday and Tuesday and then uh to add another strange TST they close on Wednesday so they're like now what um so until just Monday and Tuesday in Pennsylvania to uh go to the county office first about you can you can hand in right there doesn't need to go even go in the mail or anything um and that's the best way to do it um you can use the mail but just do person and then then on for some reason on Wednesday you cannot do it anymore until November 5th so um that's that's high urgency for Monday and Tuesday big deal um and this this is you know this is an election that I think frankly is is a FK in the road of of Destiny you know it really is so you know it's yeah it's it's it's like we need safe cities secure borders know spending I mean basic stuff you know and we need to get rid of like I mean I always feel like it's bad to like attack theet you know it's a machine it's just like this this big govern machine and there little puppet and like no point like attacking AET just you know it's like like you know I made a joke it was sort of Mis that like nobody even this to try to that's pointless let's get another so every nobody B this nobody nobody tried to kill B like that Trump tce somebody's already dead try to kill him so uh you know one foot and four toes in the grave I mean I saw week bonies and hly the corpse more who running the country see the cors had more life than Biden like for actually so uh you know who's even running the country like like like like who's in charge I I it's confusing is you Trump sure he will be hopefully um but I just sort of Wonder like L Biden is non compus mantis so who is actually in charge um the machine I I think it's just it's just the like the big government machine basically is is what's in charge um it's but it's bizarre um you know so uh yeah I mean obviously with with Trump the the great thing is that we have a real individual who is not beholden to anyone and that's what scares the machine and that's why the machine's trying to kill him yeah [Applause] so so yeah um wild times man wild times I mean I I've I've had quite a few friends call me and say have you impr you need you should definitely improve your security I'm like that's probably a good idea fine I'm like they're like they're definitely going to try to kill you I'm like uh yeah that's a good chance they might try to do that yeah um so yeah exactly if they shoot they better not miss so I'll find out who was behind him not just who the gunman was um so but it it it is it is crazy to think that uh you know we have a presidential candidate who that they've tried to kill twice in in recent months and they try to get them more you know with lawfare six ways to Sunday to try to prevent people from actually voting in a democratic way it's it's outrageous really um what are they you know what are they afraid of um so yeah I think it's is it's kind of the truth um and uh i' certainly encourage people if if people haven't seen the U the conversation between uh Joe Rogan and Donald Trump that was uh that was super cool I mean I think I think for for a lot of people it's like you know how do you know how do you understand somebody like and and what they're about um you know like the the sort of far-left press has been going on and on about how like Trump is like Hitler like musolini and Stalin combined and you rolled them all into one and he's somehow worse than all three of them combined these are people who have killed tens of millions of people I'm like something's wrong with the Press guys you know something is wrong with the Press yeah journalism is dead like what the heck is going on it's bizarre um yeah actually exactly it's [Applause] like I mean I I do I do I do think like that that that old school journalism I call it the Legacy Media because it is kind of Legacy Media because it is it is from a time when in order to learn any news you had to aggregate the news to some Central publication and then then some editor would decide what people should hear and then they would print the newspaper with like a lot of lot of paper uh literally and then distribute that paper and that's how you learn things um but you obviously don't need that anymore you've got the internet so anyone can learn anything at any time um yeah that's why X is the future uh it's it's where it's citizen journalism where you hear from the people it's by the people for the people that's what it's all about I I think this is this this is a super super big deal and it's and it's absolutely fundamental and transformative uh that the people actually get to decide uh the news and and and what the narrative and what matters and and that the because the leg see uh media is basically you know controlled by a handful of editors and chief that's it they decide what's going to get published um that's why I really encourage everyone out there to to to write stuff on the xplatform and you know other platforms too but citizen journalism is the future you know and that's where you get to hear from actual experts in the field people who really who are experts in in any given industry um and you get to hear the rebuttal so if somebody says something that's that's wrong or requires more context people can add that um you know XX has got community notes which is great um you know so take Community notes I think is uh got a very good batting average it's not perfect but it's got a very good B batting average um and and I you know many times I've gotten requests like can we get rid of this community note I'm like no we cannot um not even a community note on myself so with Community notes all the code is open source all the data is open source so you can recreate any given Community note independently and that transparency is how you know that it's true and it's real and it's honest so that's that's yeah but and I think we've got you know besides man this this the mic feedback is getting a little crazy um so maybe I should should I go further back or further forward well there's an x on the floor I guess I'm guessing that's where I should stand okay um yeah all [Laughter] right all right um yeah so yeah the landing The Rock Tri was pretty cool that was an amazing uh thing so yeah this this SpaceX team is an incredible team um and uh it's it's wild that this giant 250 ton object went to space by giant megazilla arms it's like you know it's super cool that's the kind of thing that uh you know that I think is is inspiring and exciting um and you know there's a lot of potential I think we can actually build a a permanently occupied science base on the moon uh we can build a city on Mars we can be a [Applause] multiplanetary feet Academy we want to make starle Academy real you know and um and go out there and visit other star systems eventually and see if there are alien civilizations maybe they're alien civilizations that that existed for millions of years and and we just find the you know the ruins of many long dead alien civilizations I don't know well they might [Laughter] be but very interesting to see uh you know because you know at least going to physics the universe is 13.8 billion years old and Earth is about 4 and a half billion years old so even if you just increment the time counter by a million years you have to go three digits past decimal place to go ploop a million years and the oldest writing that we've discovered in Archaeology is only 5,500 years old only that's nothing that's a millionth of Earth's existence it was the first writing and and you really have to hand it to the ancient samarians by the way uh they got a lot of Firsts those ancient samarians they're really knocking out of the park frankly um you know just with the clay tablets and everything it's uh thank thankfully they WR in clay tablets it was quite helpful um I mean they've even discovered like uh schoolwork like where they teach the kids uniform on clay tablets and then there's the teacher correcting the uniform in red ink it's been going on for a while so um yeah we are a mere 5500 year old civilization just a baby really uh but uh with a lot of potential I think we you know we can go out there and we can make life multiplanetary uh understand the universe find out what's going on maybe the aliens will come visit us maybe maybe they are here right now I don't know um [Laughter] so alien registration card so um yeah people do ask me like do I think aliens or amongs I'm like I haven't seen any um yeah there's illegal aliens but there's a lot of those but uh but not I haven't seen any like sort of green aliens with antennas on their head or anything like that um and uh maybe they are they just very subtle uh but I haven't seen them so uh but but I think we we we want to be kind of we want to be the aliens exploring other galaxies you know and uh you know I grew up watching Star Trek and Star Wars was the first movie that I ever saw in a theater and it obviously affected me a lot and um we just want to have you these sort of Glorious amazing I don't know space future real you know and and uh have exciting inspiring things that make you glad to wake up when you wake up in the morning you're glad to be alive there have to be these things you know life cannot yeah so yeah so yeah um well I think we can so that you can travel to Mars roughly every two years so every 26 months the planet's align and you can travel from from Earth to Mars and we're actually uh at a planetary alignment moment right now or in the next few months and so in roughly two years there will be another planetary alignment and uh and that's when we intend to send the first Starship uh Rockets to Mars so that's I think we can probably send quite a few in in two years and then if those land successfully and we do not increment the crater count in Mars um crater count before and after equals the same uh then we can send people in four years um yeah we we will be illegal aliens on Mars you know um I guess if there's any you know if any any uh martians um maybe they'll make Mars great again yeah you know Mars did have oceans a long time ago it's it seems like yeah like when Mars was a lot hotter uh it had lot what appears to be liquid oceans and if you warmed Mars up it would have an ocean on about 40% of the Earth's of of of Mars's surface so Mars would be about have an ocean I think almost like a mile deep on 40% of of the surface if you just warmed it up so there's a ton of a massive amount of Frozen ice on Mars so yeah it is kind of M Mars great again uh because you can warm it up and it can be an earthlike Planet so uh I think this is actually very important for the long-term uh the longevity of of Consciousness is to be a multi-planet species it's actually very important um so because there's always some chance that something could happen on Earth um that's either you know a man-made disaster or a natural disaster like the you know the meteor that killed the dinosaurs I me there have been many mass extinction events in Earth's history um and there will be there will be mass extinction events yet there's a de facto mass extinction event of of humans actually um the the birth rate is plummeting um so but the the the probable lifespan of civilization will be much greater if we are a multiplan Planet species than if we are a single planet species we don't want to be one of those lame One Planet civilizations is what I'm saying you know so uh we want to be a multiplet civilization and know just I'm not talking about like a lot of resources like I don't know 1% of our resources seems like a a wise move to be a multiplet species and and kind of just ultimately find out what's going on like visit other visit other star systems and and I think one day Mars may actually play a role similar to the role that America has played in saving the world you know America saved the world three times last century that's a big deal World War I 2 and the Cold War so Earth would be very different if not for for America saving the day three times last century so yeah amen indeed so so I think in the future Mars you used to call America the new world and Mars would be the new new world and I but actually you know planet um so I think I think one day Mars may save Earth just as America saved uh the rest of the world I think that's a big deal [Applause] so yeah as you can tell I I love space and Rockets case case that wasn't obvious so let's see we can go right into questions and um and just you sort of have it it's always good to have like get get the discussion going with people so I the lights are very bright in my eyes so I can hard I can't see what's going on there two big lines okay great well let's see how should we start okay go ahead okay sure um hi Elon my name is Ashley and I'm from Lancaster County and I have a seven-year-old son named Daniel and he made me promise that if I got to talk to you I had to tell you that he thinks that the Cyber truck is the coolest thing that has ever been invented so he owes me one now for telling you that but um so I my question centers around higher education um so I'm going to age myself a little bit but 20 years ago when I graduated high school I made the decision not to go to college and just to enter in the workforce and it worked really well for me but I did get a lot of slack from it from people that thought that that was kind of crazy um and now I've seen you know the attitude toward higher education kind of changing and that not being the only model that we have so my questions sort of twofold here um so when it comes to like my children who you know will eventually be needing to make that decision you know what decision or what what advice would you give in comparison to like a trade school higher education or just entering the workforce and from an employer standpoint in you know 10 15 years what do you think employers are going to be looking for from this next Generation that will be entering the workforce sure well I I do think that probably um too often people do do a university or college thing for four years and it's unnecessary um you know it's and then they acrew a lot of debt and it's hard to pay off the debt and and they often don't learn skills that are very useful so it's it's not you know I think we should really reconsider whether uh going to college actually makes sense um I think it doesn't always so um you know what I think and people also forget like what's the point of of a of going to school in general it's you're supposed to learn useful things you know it's you improve your understanding of the world and and learn skills that can help you contribute to your fellow human beings um but very often a university does the opposite in fact you know it will propagandize kids and not teach them anything useful um and just saddle them with a lot of debt so so I think uh you know what what really matters is like are you doing something useful to help your fellow human beings are you contributing more than you take and if you are that's a a great thing so now we are headed into a pretty wild future here with artificial intelligence and Robotics um I I think especially if if you look say like 10 10 years from now or more um that we're going to have the world is going to look very different um I think it's it's like 80% likely to be good you know like the glass is 80% full you know um and and most likely we'll have I think we'll probably have a situation which is universal High income actually not Universal basic income but Universal High income and uh there will be no shortage of goods and services that is what I think is most likely to occur um and we need to make sure that this AI is and and these robots are on the side of humanity you know obviously you know James Cameron made a made a couple movies about that um you know it's you got to watch what what you program these robots to do um and uh you know the example I've used a few times is uh you know when when Google Gemini came out uh people asked well which one's worse misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or Global th nuclear war and said well miss Jenner and kayin jener is worse it's like we've got a problem with the sayi and and even Caitlyn Jenna said yeah you should definitely misgender me uh that's crazy um so you know that we don't want to have an AI That's that concludes that the best way to avoid misgendering is to execute all humans that therefore reducing the probability of misgendering to zero because there are no humans you know like that's the kind of crazy stuff that that could potentially happen that we want to avoid which is why I think we we want to have a maximum truth seeking AI um it's got to be kind kind of based in a good way um and just be hon an honest and truthful and forthright AI that that's the best path to safety for artificial [Applause] intelligence hi Elon I'm Christine I'm from Lancaster County I want to extend a heartfelt welcome from all of us in Lancaster County thank you thank you for all that you do my question surrounds government and efficiency what would be your plan to make government more efficient yeah well so I do I think the first of all um in terms of people ask like where would you start with government efficiency it's and it's kind of like being in a room where the entire room is targets and so you can shoot shoot in any direction and not miss it's like just impossible to miss because every direction is a target so no Miss possibility um now we do have a fundamental issue which is that that the government is spending far much that far far more than it brings in um and the reality is that all all government spending is actually taxation all government spending is taxation sometimes people think some of it is Taxation and some of it's not but it's all taxation because the part that is not covered by by tax revenue becomes inflation so you're either taxed directly or you're taxed via inflation but you but you're for for sure taxed and and and so all governments spending these taxation so we have to reduce government spending overall like this this will be forced upon us in the future um because already uh just the interest payments on the debt are 23% of old federal tax revenue just the interest payments the interest payments now exceed the defense department budget which is a trillion dollars a year that's a lot of money so just the interest on the debt is exceeds what we spend on the military just the interest and that is rising rapidly so so it can't be like you know we'll we'll trim a little bit here and there that's not going to work there H there have to be quite radical reductions in cost yeah and I think we just need to be you know um if you know please Lord Trump wins uh the you know and and and the department of government efficiency happens we want we're going to be very open and transparent and be very clear about this is what we're doing here are the issues this is this is the the math for what what's being spent and and what you know and and we're going to make it we're going to make the spending lower and if if somebody's got a better idea for how to make the spending lower we're tell us but but if we don't we're going to bankrupt the country and and so we got to do something and and it's got to be a like some pretty big moves SW yeah i' say like drain drain the swamps this is like a there's so many swamps it's it's like you know so many swamps there's yeah yeah I mean it's just nutty that like there was a massive increase in IRS personnel and and and instead of adding people to the border patrol like this is totally backwards it's it's like like you can continue to remain remain a federal employee but you have to go God the Border that's your new job you know um it's it's it's like why are we why are we spending money and applying resources to oppress the American people uh while rolling out a r carporate for illegal so it doesn't make any sense so so yeah it would have to be pretty big I mean there's actually have tried Googling it and I've asked all the AIS how how many how many government agencies are there and even the government doesn't know okay and the AIS don't know like you they're like well it's a about 450 but maybe it's 420 I'm like 420 no kidding that's that's a lot of agencies uh just at the federal level I mean like if you sort of stand back and say okay just for a second like let's say we're starting the country again how many agencies do we need do we need more than 99 because that's 99 is a lot of agencies you know like that's that's still a lot you know if you said like do any how many people even know at 99 agencies I'd say most I'd say practically no one knows 99 knows the names of 99 agencies let alone the 420 or whatever there are yeah so we we have to unwind the situation um and uh and and I think well I think we're going to do it and it's going to unleash a a new era of prosperity um because people that don't even realize how much they're getting held back by uh millions of federal regulations Millions literally so and if it turns out that that that we accidentally got rid of a good regulation we'll just put it back is that easy hey Elon uh I'm Dan from uh Pennsylvania as well um I am a teacher public school teacher and um I just bought a Tesla this year and it's been amazing for my 1hour commute great so thank you about that cool um driving yes oh my gosh cool it it blows like I when I go into the teacher parking lot and I just tried the summon today yeah like yeah everybody's Jaws hit the floor yeah it's wild yeah so um Republicans need to get out the vote and as the mail in balloting becomes more common what can I tell my friends about the Safety and Security of mail and ballots yeah um this election and future elections um and then uh real quick also sure my daughter is uh is two she her name is Isabella she loves the planets and loves uh astronomy is already and I want to know what I can as a teacher do to help Inspire her curiosity for the heav of the Stars sure um well with Bic with respect to uh voting voting Integrity um I think probably the best thing to do is to hand it in in person um but you can also mail it in and you can check to see whether your your ballot has been received so it is possible to check online or in person see if your ballot has been received uh but I would encourage people to vote early because what can happen is that you know November 5th comes around and there's like you got something critical at work or there's like a family emergency or you know that's yeah some mysterious cyber security event that you never know might happen uh so you know anything can crop up on November 5th whether it's personal or some you know there could be some other some other issue so it's it's it is best to vote early um now it is very encouraging to see the early vote numbers uh because if you compare the early vote numbers this year to 2020 uh there's about a I think the last numbers I saw it's like a two to 300,000 voter difference from 2020 that's a huge that's major because because I think it was like an 880,000 vote uh threshold last time so Biden won is bye but by 880,000 880,000 votes that was the number that was reported and and but the interesting thing is that that that the the delta or early votes is now 200 I think maybe approaching 250 or even 300,000 uh in uh better than 2020 Which is far in excess of the margin of the 20 of 2020 so Pennsylvania is trending in the right direction it's very encouraging [Applause] but but there's still a lot of work to do and we don't want to be complacent so uh definitely get everyone you know to to vote and as I mentioned earlier uh people can actually go in in person on Monday and Tuesday if they're concerned about uh putting anything in the mail and and they can actually get their ballot like even if they don't have their ballot they can literally go to the the county office get the ballot even though it says absentee and then hand it in even though you're not absent it's weird but it works but it's it stops working on Wednesday and then the next opportunity is November 5th so it's kind of quirky but that's that's those are the current rules um and then let's see with respect to your daughter um and you know I think um in order to inspire like kids are inspired by real amazing imagery like they see something amazing they see a rocket taking off a rocket Landing uh or you know robots walking around or like cool things like the stuff that you see in Sci-Fi movies um And when they see stuff like that they're they're they're inspired automatically they're inspired because it's because there are real advancements in technology um and that's uh you know that that's that's what inspires kids because it because a Shir um you like kids are like a great filter for for what's awesome like you can tell like if a little kid reacts like wow that's amazing and that's like that's real you know um so like kids love the Cyber truck and they love Rockets you know and and that's because and they have no filter they just say what they they immediately say what they think you know so um yeah so it's it's great new rocket technology that allows us to like I said go there and be have a a permanent science science station on the moon you not just like it's great that we're into the moon you 50 plus years ago uh but we want to go to the moon and actually have a science base like we've got a science base in Antarctica well we should have a science base on the moon and we should be building a city on Mars and I I actually think it's it's a the the long-term future of civilization I think could be decided by whether or not we we build a self-sustaining City on Mars um and if we do that that is a city that would have millions of people and it would be like if anybody wants to go to Mars they could and that would be an incredibly exciting inspiring thing to to to Aspire to go to Mars feel like Wow Let's make that real let's bring her to Mars yes let's bring her to Mars yeah if she thinks like wow one day I could go to Mars you know and and and be one of the the Mars and that would be super awesome I think you it's it's wild you go it takes six months actually when you go from Earth to Mars you just you're just traveling across this this void of nothingness for hundreds of millions of miles until eventually you you reach another planet um it's kind of incredible to think that that's even possible but and how amazing would that be you know be like wow I think that we want to have a future where life is multiplanetary where we're advancing rocket technology and uh like I said we're we're Star Trek Starfleet Academy is real and that's what will inspire your daughter thank you all right hi Elon my name is Lauren from Pennsylvania thank you for being here thank you for everything you're doing and congratulations with SpaceX you and your whole team are absolutely brilliant I have two specific questions for you but I was curious because I looked all over on X today and I didn't see anybody who won the million dollar prize was that given out today um well let's see I'm we all we all going to give it out tonight in fact so let's is it's to go ahead and do it yeah okay let's do it good timing all right Judy kamora [Music] [Applause] yeah Judy has no idea by the way she just learning now so well I think Judy's on our way here uh like said JY had no learned when you learned all right oh thank you all [Music] right I mean we're we're trying to we're trying to get attention for this very important petition to support the Constitution and uh it's uh so you know it's it's like if we you know we need the the right to free speech we need the right to bear arms otherwise there is no right to free speech and um and yeah and and it's you know people sort of wonder why why didn't why what's up with the million dollar prizes I'm like well we needed to get the Legacy Media to talk about it and and I I just knew that they would be like complaining like hell about it that like for sure complaining on every every newspaper and every TV station are complaining like like crazy and I was like great that's going to get the word out most welcome all right can you say hi to my son Ken Hi kayen and kayy hi all right so yeah so we're going to be uh giving out a million dollars every day uh through November 5th and and all Al all you have to do is sign in the petition in support of the post Second Amendment uh that's it uh you don't you don't even have to vote be nice if you voted but you don't have to um and that to support that basically sign something you already believe in and uh you get a chance to win a million dollars every day from now through the election yeah congratulations Judy let me know if you want to share two specific questions for you Elon one regarding your concern about the declining birth rate yeah it's a big deal it is besides us as women having more and more children and since we're the only ones who can give birth yes what would you I mean you do need a womb without is you need a womb is necessary otherwise you can't have kids currently it is necessary yes what would be your solution would you be in favor of creating or supporting an IVF cacy program to increase the birth rates and my second question is about what would you recommend towards the first steps on improving our American educational system thank you yeah I mean in general like I think we should really view the the birth rate has like extremely fundamental crisis um like it's it's really shocking how low it it is um you know the the birth rate in America in the United States has been below replacement rate since I was born roughly roughly around 1971 or so uh that's since then America has been below replacement rate and and pretty much every country seem it seems as soon as they reach a certain level of prosperity the birth rate drops uh below replacement and then I started looking into well has this happened before in history and in fact it has it's in in in basically every civilization in the past um it's it's maybe counterintuitive but the more prosperous that a civilization becomes the lower the birth rate so it it's because you think well well with prosperity you'd have more resources then you'd have more kids actually no um the historical fact is that the longer that a civilization has been prosperous the worse its birth rate G um and this was an issue even in ancient Rome like in 50 BC there's like actually we we still have like the Roman laws that were written they they passed laws to try to improve the birth rate of of Roman citizens in 50 BC um so like basically this is a fundamental civilizational challenge that has been encountered many times before um it's not something that just you know happened recently it's it's it's occurred throughout the cycle of civilizations um and I I I don't I hope we can at least partly reverse it um and I think part of that is at least bringing it to conscious awareness because I meet many people who think that there are too many humans on Earth but this is not true there aren't enough humans on Earth in fact you can fit all the humans on Earth in the city of New York on one floor okay so or like if if you if you fly across the country and you look down and say if you if you're if you had a drop a ball in someone's head uh would you succeed and you would not uh because uh the density of people is very low there's the there actually very few people on Earth uh it's only if you live in a very dense City environment that it seems that there are many people that that Earth is densely populated but it is only densely populated in like 0.1% of the surface area so least want to bring it to conscious awareness so people don't think that Earth is overpopulated when in fact Earth is underpopulated that is the truth yeah yeah well B Gates is and I are not best friends to say the least um so I don't know he is you know I think there's you can you can arguably arguably say like look that maybe the real distinction is not right or left but is someone an expansionist or extinctionist so he has some issues this is true um so but but like if you you say like like any given civilization it's it's not going to be exactly steady so it's like they so any given civilization is either going to be growing or declining and so you have to say you can kind of divide any person's actions into are they expansionist or extinctionist um and I mean obviously I'm super expansionist oriented because I think that's a far more exciting future than going extinct uh you know sounds obvious when you say it like that um so yeah so it's just um but I I still run into a lot of people who think Earth is over overpopulated so I'm like kind of hammering this point we're not overpopulated we're underpopulated and uh you know so so I'm in favor of really you know we need to have we babies by whatever means whether it's ibf sagy whatever the case may be um you know that can that can certainly help um and but we just can't go extinct like with humans need to you know I think humanity is great and we should have get bigger you know we we want to exp I think we we should expand the scope and scale of Consciousness so we can better understand the nature of the universe I mean that's the foundation of My Philosophy yeah make babies great again yes um so yeah hopefully that was that was helpful so thank you yeah um hi I'm Mary wrestler and I live in Lancaster PA I'm a teacher here um I've been following you because of your work with World literacy with X prise as I was a participant in Barbara Bush x prise with an app development called literacy Speedway but but my passion is turning because since covid every day in the trenches in the classroom I see the effects of mental health on our students not only students but I've seen two of my brothers commit suicide I've seen my own daughter who wasn't able to get a bed in a facility in had A8 months I have seen what's happened to American families because of the Mental Health crisis and the lack of resources our mental health system in America is broken and so even though I have a passion for ly and always will I also would like to ask you because I know of your collaboration your contacts contacts with the election with um what the new Administration can possibly do what can you guys do to fix our broken mental health system in America sure well I mean I'd be curious to hear your thoughts and suggestions um I mean my my sort of observation is that we do we overprescribe medication um and and and and we that you know like there's a a lot of Regulation uh in fact too much regulation about getting any any given medication approved but then after it's approved there's no followup to see hey did we make a mistake um and then you get so get things that are approved and they just go Hog Wild and uh and causing a lot of damage but there's there's not really a good re revocation capability so it doesn't make sense like there are good drugs that are not being approved and there are bad drugs that have been approved this is a broken system we need to fix it um I think very often when when somebody has committed suicide or if they've essentially done done if they' something's if they' something is bad has happened like what were they prescribed that is an important thing do you have any thoughts on those um I do have thoughts on it I feel like in the brook and mortar school and the educational setting not only do the states because I know it's it's education is stay dictated even though there's National National Common Core Curriculum that there needs to be Mental Health Services embedded into every school at this juncture there also needs to be facilities in every state not a six-month wait to stay psychiatrist as in Pennsylvania at times or a 12 months to get a bed and a mental facility the asylums unfortunately weren't the fix years ago in America because they were horrible but when they were taken away Authority went to the States Federal money was taken away and now you have outpatient services and there's a a lack of prescribers there's a lack of counselors there's a need for more and every day our prison system right now is housing half almost and I could give you the data to to you know um they're they're not there because they're criminals they're there because they have mental health issues and it needs fixed okay are there any particular medications you think should be pulled from the market or added to the market um I believe that every child when they're diagnosed with a mental health condition should have there's there is a test for it there's um some kind of tongue test that that can dictate which medications will work and won't work for you however you have to ask as a parent for that test and I can guarantee from my experience in this with parents working in the school district or just from friends and um other associates most people aren't even aware of it because it's not paid by for insurance and most Americans can't afford it so when things aren't um covered under your insurance um they're not given like a doctor isn't going to prescribe that that is done so you have to have the self- awaren and um knowledge to go and have that testing done and most people unfortunately just don't know it even exists okay all right well I think this is definitely and and it's something we need to to figure figure out better um there there clearly uh I agree with you that this this there's a mental health issue I I think we need to look into like what Dr what drugs actually work and and and and what are the side effects and uh and some of them I I mean yeah I think I think some of them are are are pretty sketch frankly that some of the drugs that are that are prescribed um I mean some of the stories I've heard about some of the psych psych psychiatric meds from people are are pretty bad like it's like the reason they wanted in this in some case the reason they wanted to commit suicide is be when they when they took the drugs not when they didn't take the drugs you know people people do need to believe in something so um you know I think I think they they're probably nature of of hor of vacuum so if if there is you know there's certainly a strong argument that the decline in religion has has led to people seeking a new religion essentially secular religion um so that is uh you know wokeism is essentially a secular religion um but it's it's believed very fervently um so yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's a strong strong argument for church I agree so oh that's true all right well let's see so hi hi good evening my name is Janelle it's nice to meet you nice to meet you I wanted to actually first thank you and probably behalf on everyone here to thank you for creating the pack and the referral opportunity I think everyone here is grateful I saw it as a way to support two amendments that I actually care about and don't want to see go away and secondly I saw it as a way that if I could refer my friends family and everyone that I could go I could earn some extra money yeah my husband and I are actually self in our own fertility Journey I've got some unexplained infertility and so that money is going to actually pay our bill next month right and um I've always wanted to become a mom and I have a dream to be a mom and I know one day it will happen I'm drawn to your population concerns I don't know if you've talked to president Trump but I would love to know if you would consider pack or advocating a grant for fertility to make Americans like myself be able to afford it and have a baby yeah well I I'm I'm I'm super pro baby so yes yeah absolutely I'm super super super pro baby so yes [Applause] absolutely hey Elon my name is Ferman Jones and uh I just wanted to start out and say I I really believe in you thank you and I know everybody in here believes in you for one reason or another and I'm super thankful to even get to ask you question um but anyways I also believe in the Constitution and I also believe in the Bible and that's what I'm going to ask you about sure um the Bible says that nobody's perfect and there's no perfect form of government on this Earth because greed is inevitable um it's like Churchill says that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other types right um but the one government that the Bible does say is perfect is the kingdom of God and Isaiah 33:22 says the Lord is our judge the Lord is our king and the Lord is our uh our lawmaker yeah so I feel like so much of your worldview aligns with Biblical principles and we need Christians to vote and see that greed that communism is the greatest manifestation of evil and greed and so yeah that's my question how do we get Christians to vote and if you have time what keeps you from believing in the Bible or being more vocal about it so yeah well it is interesting that actually I was told that a surprisingly small percentage of um evangelicals of of people that are really strong believers act it's quite a small percentage that votes I I thought and I I hope yeah well I this what I was told anyway um but but I saw I certainly hope uh more more people more Christians vote that would be great please do um so um yeah I mean I so I was uh you know uh brought up uh Christian and uh went to uh actually somewhat strangely went to Sunday school and and also my I was sent to a Hebrew preschool um you know I'm not Jewish but I was I don't know uh just still I think it was in the neighborhood or something you know um and um so I was like hoping a gila one day Jesus Is Our Lord the next and I was like great um so you know uh so I you know I certainly I'm I'm I'm I I believe in the like the teachings of Christ I believe you know that he's like I believe in the Christian principles um uh you know love thy neighbor I I believe in turn the other cheek which is very important for to have forgiveness because if you don't have forgiveness then you have an endless cycle of Retribution um you know like you know I I used to think like why would you turnone the other cheek that's ridiculous uh you know just punch him but and and I I think you do need to actually be strong like you you can't be weak because if somebody's if if you're facing sort of a a predatory threat uh and that threat is stronger than you and that and that threat doesn't believe in Christian values then you will just get you know executed I mean I don't know but but at a at a certain point you you it once you are strong once you are once you're strong you should you should forgive the the the transgressions of of others um you know and this is obviously not something they believe in the Middle East uh which is why there's this endless cycle of of violence um you know so I really think that uh yeah um we should uh yeah should love the neighbor and and we should forgive and we should uh we should be kind and gentle so yeah I believe I believe in what Jesus I believe I believe in what Jesus said yeah so yeah hello Elon Musk my name is Grant Nogle Hi family it's really really good to to meet you uh my first question was do you have an answer to life the universe and everything well the classic answer is 42 and and uh 420 is just 1042s um interesting but my real question yes sorry my real question would be what is the most useful most powerful piece of advice you have ever received the most useful pieces of advice well that's a tough one um H yes indeed vote Republican [Applause] [Laughter] um yeah um I I mean this is this is maybe going to sound like maybe I I like I believe in like like well if you study Physics if you if you study I I just recommend studying physics uh uh you know and and and and the the tools of physics of the the sort of the The Thinking Tools um that it's it's it's not it's not just a bunch of it's what matters is not remembering a bunch of formulas um what matters is the thinking process that led to the discovery of those formulas um it's sort of critical thinking first principles analysis um trying to understand what is true at a most fundamental level and then reasoning up from there and testing your conclusions against uh the most fundamental truths in any given Arena um this is how you can figure out whether something is more likely to be true or not and I think it's it's good to think in terms of probabilities so so you receive information about a subject that should that should change the probability of your conclusion but but not the certainty of your conclusion like so in physics teaches you that you should not be 100% certain that about any given prediction um now there's some things that are highly likely but but physics teaches you you you've got to you got to assign a probability to something being true and and then as you learn more information uh your original conclusion may be wrong um and then you you know you should then change your mind based on the new information um I mean you can think of intelligence kind of as just how good is um how I think the yeah probably the right metric for intelligence is the ability to predict predict the future if you can predict the future well then you're then you're you're you're as intelligent as you can predict the future well because if something if somebody claims well this is a thing is this this person or or this AI is very intelligent like well what how good are its predictions and if its predictions are not very good it's not that smart so so that's that's uh I think the key nature of intelligence and if you're trying to decide what to do in the future it is really it just it comes down to predicting the future and to predict the future you have to think critically about the past um and constantly try to be less wrong so maybe that would be a maybe that would be right up there in terms of best advice aspire to be less wrong [Applause] hi Elon yes first off thank you so much for having us here today we always appreciate that we have somebody in in your level of influence that can listen to regular people and and kind of get our voices heard and it's also not every day that a person gets to meet their hero and ask them a question so my main question is since covid the current Administration has really put a struggle with small businesses and especially here in PA we've seen a large decline in both the foundation of small business and I've personally known several small businesses that have had the close uh due to increasing regulation taxes name exactly it's it's the the burden of of excess regulation is very severe um and it crushes a lot of small small companies and and it makes big companies operate much much less efficiently so so so how do you think that we as small business owners and non-s small business owners can fight against this and also what can you do as a former small business owner uh that you can kind of fight for us well I mean to your point I think a a dramatic reduction in uh government spending and government uh overregulation like I call it sort of America is getting sort of strangulation by overregulation um will unleash a new era of prosperity um just allow people to do useful and productive things and don't make it a a two-year permitting nightmare which it often is um and then burden uh small businesses with taxes that make them go bankrupt so the yeah it's pretty straightforward um like I said it's kind of mind-blowing that there are over 400 federal agencies governing Our Lives most of them people have never heard of but they they they do affect your life and you unbalance negatively um so we just need far fewer agencies um and get the government off your back yeah hi my name my name is Mark from Lancaster thank you for your time I'm sure it's the most valuable thing you can give to any organization so thank you I'm is the currency thank you sir um so my question is my wife's a naturalist US citizen she's registered to vote I banked my vote already um I was just wondering if you've been willing to talk about I mean we did it the right way we took years and money and we got her naturalized the right way other um if you'd be want to talk about your experience at all with immigration and also other than secure border how you see fixing that system yeah well since your wife has gone through the the um process of becoming a citizen and getting green card you've seen how absurdly slow and arduous it is um so I mean I think the the general principle that makes sense is the same principle that you'd operate a professional sports team on or a company which is like who would you want on your team and if if somebody's going to be productive like productive and honest and a net contributor and that'd be a great addition to the team welcome aboard it should be not a long process because they they'll they'll produce more than they consume they'll make everyone everyone's lives better and so we have this bizarre situation which is like mindblowing that it is easier to get into this country as a murderer than as a Nobel laurat literally that's not an exaggeration which is like what you know it's like I mean it's like if like if if you have the opportunity to say have like uh you know LeBron James or Steph Curry on your team and you be like yeah that would make total sense our team's going to win they'll make the whole team better you know so we we we we want to actually we need to have things be what they should which is that that legal immigration of honest hardworking talented people is quick and easy and coming into the country illegally is hard that's how it should be yeah so honestly like okay I had like kind of a crazy idea this is this one's going to hit the Press um which is like what if we gave legal immigration job to Chick-fil-A they are so efficient they make an amazing chicken sandwich their chicken sandwiches are epic and they make a zillion of them and they just get it done I think we should give the immigration job to check Fil-A they'll Crush that's going to be a headline hello Mr musk but honestly it would be great hello Mr musk it's an honor to meet you so my question is this and I ask this as a firsttime voter as we know Trump did not and has not accepted the results of the 2020 election one which has been called the most secure in the nation's history by the former president's own Department of Homeland Security similarly similarly I saw the violent disruption of the electoral vote count on the news during January 6th and so my and I asked this is a first-time voter who wants to discern the truth sure what would you say to comfort the concerns of young voters like me who are worried that voting for a second Trump presidency will lead to democratic backsliding repic demat well I think that's a fair question honestly the I think it it it is it is a it is a fair question I mean the the thing is that um yeah like I want to frame this correctly and obviously anything I say the the Legacy Media is going to take a sound bite uh out of what I say and and and Mis and misconstrue what I'm saying um which is something they've done with President Trump many times it is very important if you if you've heard something bad about President Trump listen to his whole speech that's actually very important you know um and uh you know on January 6 I mean his statements on that day he told people to back down I mean he said he said do not do violence and and then people were like saying well that's actually some sort of dog Wille about doing violence I'm like what are you supposed to say you know he he did actually tell to to not not be violent he recommended uh that the National Guard be deployed uh Nancy poosi said no don't believe I was there didn't call for any violence he didn't call for any violence exactly and if you look at like while it's obviously you know I think it was you know an un like the level of disruption uh was was high and I I don't I don't applaud any any kind of uh damage to public property of course um that you know but it's you know the media tries to characterize January 6th as some some some sort of violent Insurrection which is simply not the case I mean that is false um so you know I I I I would take I think probably what I think is the reasonable Middle Ground which is I I disagree with the level of protest test but it's it is is in was in no way a violent Insurrection you know that so that there's got to be a lot of guns for the to a violent Insurrection um and uh and and there were um there were a lot of strange things from a v in terms of voting irregularities that are hard to explain so uh what what it's yeah I mean there were things that are statistically unlikely let me put it that way um and and so it it's not as though the J January 6 protesters had that their protests had no merit they had some Merit I disagree with the the magnitude of what they did but I I I I but it's it's not as though there were no issues there were actually there were issues um and and we have this weird situation in America where uh it is almost impossible to prove fraud and it because if you've got no voter ID and mail in ballots how do you how do you prove fraud um and you know and and it it does seem more than a little odd that we don't have vo ID and and then you look at say States like California which is super majority Democrat they passed a law Banning voter ID in any election whatsoever now how is that supporting democracy that's not supporting democracy um I mean that's insane almost every country on Earth has voter ID requirements but we don't why and why do the same people that demanded vaccine IDs for you to do anything are the same ones who say no ID for voting something doesn't add up it doesn't it doesn't add up you know you know so I I I actually think I I mean my my my opinion is that those who who say Trump is a threat to democracy are themselves the threat to democracy Make Some Noise [Applause] yeah woo I'll tell you what that was awesome conspiracy was Theory and now it's the truth I mean honestly you at this point at this point we're running out of conspiracy theories because there's so many of them have come true right that that that we need we we actually need uh can someone please come up with some new conspiracies the government's here to help the government's I mean even the frogs might be real you know the Frog situation might be I don't know right you know conspiracy the and we're here to help you you probably heard that right right well Elon God bless you it's very nice to meet you God bless you my name is Andrew morisy uh Lancaster PA n native yeah I'm a small business owner of a barber shop 10 minutes down the street great called Legacy Barbers love to cut your hair sometime if you will thank you so I wanted to uh ask you a question and also encourage you uh with these few words um Augustine who was a theologian and a philosopher said you have made us for yourself oh Lord and our heart is restless until it rests in you and uh 2 Chronicles 7:14 says if my people who are called by my name should humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and heal their land so I want to encourage you with that brother yeah those are a great great Woods Great Woods amen amen and uh Elon I I'll tell you what been watching you now for a while hearing the stuff you say we need more men like you in this country that do that are not afraid to stand up to the media Legacy yeah uh they're not afraid to stand up against uh uh people who think we're toxic MX masculinity we need more men yeah you know this I've got a great counterargument for toxic masculinity which is if if masculinity is so toxic how come the kids that are messed up don't have dads Riddle Me That riddle me that and some something that you said earlier and an amen to that yeah and I'm actually going to be a dad February 3rd congratulations I'm having a baby W thank you Lord um but the tweet that you had uh not too long ago it said and no one is even trying to assassinate Biden or Camala yeah because it's pointless so nobody nobody bother assassinating a puppet right yeah you know when are people going to start seeing that our country is not when they keep saying democracy it's a constitutional republic would you please make sure if if you don't mind to keep reminding people yeah that we are a republic we're free we're free because of Christ Jesus and we're free because of the men and women who died and shed blood for this country that's absolutely yes Amen [Music] brother yeah yeah you're right I mean a lot of people died to make this country what it is today a lot of people died um absolutely amen and uh man people take it for granted you know so yeah well America pack is kind of the anti- Saurus pack you know something's got to be done about it so it's like uh you know I I don't know what's up with that guy but honestly like putting da and like it's like it's like like the Joker's in charge you know yeah uh like electing Das that don't prosecute crime is insane that's like literally like Batman Dark Knight I like you know lock up the lock up the citizens and free the criminals it's insane it's happening through yeah I mean like what this is total Madness so we need to get stop that yeah so make America great again yeah well I think America is great but we want to be greater and we want to do awesome things we we want to do and and you want to you want to look forward to the future and be inspired and excited about the future you know that's what makes life worth living another thing yeah so all right have you ever looked into the sport of arm wrestling oh yeah arm wrestling uh I I I have looked I not not in depth but I have looked into it and um for for for a while there I I did like actually read up on it and and actually various techniques for how to win at arm wrestling which is like a lot of it is you know get get your angles to yeah get you get your whole body into it and and and uh get your angles so you can actually like if if you know the techniques in arm wrestling and somebody doesn't you can actually uh win against somebody much bigger um yeah well yeah no no I mean I I I would challenge Biden but that would be ridiculous you know that'd be so unfair so thank you um he can use two what if he uses two hands yeah that'll be fine he probably will make make arm wrestling great again yeah make arm wrestling great again absolutely God bless thank you God bless all right hi Elon my name is Molly I just want to thank you for spending so much time in Pennsylvania I think what you're doing is amazing it's making real impact so God bless you and uh than you're National Treasure thank you my main concern is with the national debt and I know you talked a lot about reducing the spending side but I was wondering what kind of trump policies and industries you think will help grow the revenue side and along those lines do you have any plans to bring more Tesla manufacturing back to the US well Tesla actually is a massive manufacturer in the US in fact the the biggest Factory uh that's been built in recent years is the Tesla Factory uh in Texas so that's a yeah and and then there's another big Factory in Nevada uh so there's Giga Nevada um and uh Giga Texas and maybe someday Giga Pennsylvania so that that that would be that would be super cool I'm I'm a huge believer in manufacturing I love love manufacturing I like making things um I've spent uh a lot of time in the factory Walking the Floor I lived in the factory for a while um literally lived in the factory uh it was kind of like just kind of like Vegas actually because I didn't even see the outside but the lights were always on um but uh we had some tough times in Tesla it's really difficult to make any kind of manufacturing company work um and uh you know yeah Tes is actually also the biggest um manufacturing employer in California still um but state is not super grateful um so but but yeah I'm I'm big so so we we do a ton of manufacturing in the US uh and we we we we keep investing um and increasing our manufacturing activity in the US and and SpaceX also is a massive manufacturer uh SpaceX is the biggest manufacturer of rockets and satellites in the world um and uh yeah yeah so and and that's that's that's all in the US so SpaceX manufacturing is all in the US um and uh and Tesla has massive amounts of manufacturing in the US like giant factories um so I'm a big believer in manufacturing um so from I mean I do think uh reform of the tax code would make sense because it's extremely complicated and there are too many loopholes um you know I'm often pitched on these loopholes that's how I know they exist and I'm like that sounds pretty shady I don't think we should do that're like well lots of other people are getting away with it we're like yeah but I still don't think we should do it um yeah for what is worth I'm the the the the largest individual taxpayer in history so I I paid 10 billion in tax over10 billion in tax you're welcome like I I I sort of thought maybe the IRS would like you know send me like a little trophy or something you know like one of those like doesn't have to be expensive it could be like you know one of those like like things you get for when kids win a Katey competition like little plastic gold trophy or something like that or a cookie or something but I didn't get anything I it's like you know and uh but I I was happy to pay the taxes I don't mind you know um yeah it's good week this week yeah uh stock Mark is wild wild uh sort of roller coaster um you know I think Warren Buffett's got a good good uh a lot of good sayings actually but what one of his sayings I believe is like you know having a publicly traded company is like having someone stand outside your house and yell house prices all day and it's still the same house and you're like why is this person yelling house prices at me all day long and that's what it's like being in a publicly traded company it's just they just yell stock prices at you all day long and it's like well it's actually still pretty much the same company as yesterday um so um it's it's it's it's kind of weird being in a publicly traded situation um but anyway I think we should we should simplify the tax code uh get rid of a lot of exceptions and loopholes um and make it easy to fill out taxes it shouldn't be this like extremely complicated thing um yeah but but overall I think the like if we if we have less federal spending then there's less taxation um and so that and we we we have to reduce federal spending there there's no way to make up for it other than than reducing the federal spending um and as I mentioned earlier like a very important point that I think is important for people to understand is that all federal spending is taxation um because what is not what they don't receive what the federal government doesn't receive in direct Revenue they make up for in inflation they just print money so all federal spending is taxation very important principle almost nobody very few people seem to even like you know somebody's like spend their life in economics I'll mention to them hey all spending all federal spending is taxation they're like first they'll argue with me and they're like then they will agree it is uh because it is either direct tax revenue or it is inflation all federal spending is taxation so we must reduce federal spending or we will go bankrupt as a country all right [Applause] hey Elon I'm Chad Wick from Westchester Pennsylvania I met you last week at uh I met you last week at Harrisburg and since then I've been prouder than ever to wear my magga hat around you've really inspired me to wear it more and more right and since then I've had my car slashed with a key which fine yeah it's fine Trump got hit with a bullet in the air and uh look at him he's doing good so uh yeah somebody chased me around the shopping cart one time as well but yeah it happens that's just live that's a part of Westchester PA it's well honestly I me I mean at at at this point it's like flying the rebel flag man yeah you know yeah for real it's an adventure um um yeah I've had some people be get get mad at me um yeah uh like big time I do have I do have a question this time though I actually I met somebody on X I do podcasting and I met somebody on X directly through the platform I would call him a friend his name is Derek and he has something called spin of beida it is spinabifida month right now so spinabifida awareness month I wanted to put the awareness out there is that it's a a spinal he born with some spinal kind of like issues and he has never been able to walk really never wow well I guess not according from what I learned and he's never he hasn't been able to walk like his whole his whole life um so my question is like for the disabled community and for people like him will things like uh will things like neuralink help and also what will the Trump Administration be doing for people who are disabled to help them anything well yeah so um I I think I think there actually are a lot of um things that like medical devices and drugs that could be approved that are sort of stuck in regulatory molasses like they're just you know it's like trying to get anything new approved is like running in molasses with lead shoes uh it's really slow uh so um you know a good friend of mine was was telling me how his mom was diagnosed with with brain cancer and the doctor said like well that's that's pretty much it's game over you know and then he talked to but he's very enterprising guy so he didn't take that that for an answer and he asked every smart person he knew is there any that that could help cure brain brain cancer it turns out there there's this drug called welli rig that was in Trials at at Harvard I believe and uh it it cured his mom's brain cancer so you know I'm like well well like how many Welly rigs are there out there maybe there's a whole bunch of them and and devices and everything and we should you know like said earlier it's like we need to expedite approval of drugs make sure people you know that people are properly informed of the pros and the cons um and then there also needs to be some after approval followup to say like was something approved that shouldn't have been approved uh and or where there need to be additional warnings um it's pretty common it's common sense I think you know just but like when you're dealing with the government like Common Sense doesn't make sense like you know Common Sense just bounces off the government like water off duck's back you know I mean it's like arguing with the MV that's impossible they put that vacc in quick though they did put the covid vaccine quick yeah that was weird and it made everyone take it which is messed up so I don't think people should be forced to take vaccine list that against their will hi Elon my name is uh Alex Gamble from Lebon County I first want to thank you sincerely for what you're doing I I think you're an American uh Patriot I really do um I love America I really do I mean I I listen I I I love America and and like sometimes people say like that's just jingoistic propaganda I'm like I don't care I love the jingoistic propaganda it's awesome you know um it's like God Bless America I freaking it's it's it's amazing yeah I agree yeah W with the recent news uh from Lancaster County um discovering 2500 potentially fraudulent voter registration forms um what's your opinion on mail and ballots and if we should get rid of them in the future um I ALS I also want to we should get rid of them in the future I mean like mail and ballots are are a strange anomaly that got popularized during covid um but but really but like you you you have a an obvious recipe for fraud and and and an inability to prove fraud if you've got no ID no voter ID and you got mailing ballots right like you can't even put a you can't even like like like like many years ago a friend of mine was telling me how his his dad actually uh helped improve democracy in Mexico um and and it was by organizing a whole bunch of citizens to just stand outside the the polling stations so the voting stations with a counter just to count the number of people that went in because obviously if you have more votes Than People something's wrong yeah and and it turned out they had a lot more votes than people they're like H this is a little strange um so anyway that that but that that actually helped fix the situation in Mexico big time um but but but if you don't if you got mailing ballots where you can't count there like you don't even know what's going on I also wanted to uh uh ask you a favor um my my son is named Elon really we named him after you wow thanks uh he's three um you're an inspiration and I was hoping to get an autograph from you to give to him when he's older as the further I can't say no to that I mean from one Elon to another you know uh actually you know I was actually I was named after my American great-grandfather uh I guess uh it's so I'm like kind of the opposite of Obama I'm I'm from Africa named after named [Laughter] African-American so but yeah uh John Elan haleman was my my great-grandfather and that's I was named after his middle name so I think it was like from Minnesota I believe so yeah hey Elon my name is Jennifer Lucas as you can tell I do not have a Pennsylvania accent but I do live here I'm voting legally I promise um sure I believe you I'm from Southern West Virginia okay and um honestly I've had a lot of um questions on my mind from education to um drug epidemic it's hit really hard but um one thing that I would really like to ask you about right now is lobbyists if I buy vote I go to jail they buy votes on the floor on the voting floor in DC and that's okay right um that is affecting our voice as American citizens so what can we do to ban lobbyists in DC so we can take our power [Applause] back a pack oh America pack um yeah I you you know so I was actually part of making a movie uh called Thank You for Smoking I don't know if anyone's seen that movie um but it's it's a movie about uh political corruption and and L about lobbyists and pol political corruption I you know it's worth watching Thank You for Smoking um and uh you know that was uh I'm I'm actually the the pilot in the movie in that plane um so it's very small role um but that movie explores the uh the the corruption that exists in DC due to all the lobbying that takes place and the the legislation is primarily written by lobbyists in fact and then you know Congress basically rubber stamps the what what lobbyists write um I think I think we probably do need to take a look at what rules make sense uh because obviously the the the point of the elected uh legislators is to legislate in the interest of the people right um and so if there's legislation happening which is often the case that is uh not in the interest of the people something's wrong um so and you do get these like regulatory capture situations where the you know the companies in an industry end up controlling The Regulators um and uh preventing new entrance from from coming into a market making it difficult you know for new companies to come in um anyway I I you know I wanted to make that movie for a reason which is to highlight that there is a lot of corruption in in ITC and uh we like to have less of it at least um and it's it's tough and you know this is also why I think the the big government machine is so against Trump because he he doesn't he's not beholden to all of these interests you know so he's he's not he's not captured essentially he's not a puppet um so the sort of the big government machine is very worried about electing someone who's who's not a puppet um so yeah I mean I I certainly advocate for you know better rules that limit the the power of companies to Lobby in in DC um or at the state level for that matter um yeah I mean like I for for Mars like people sometimes ask me like well what what kind of system of governance do I think make sense for Mars and I'm like said well that's going to be up to the Martians you know but um but but uh I would recommend direct democracy not representative democracy um where the people vote directly um and uh you know in the past before there was before you had like the internet and electronics you had to have representative democracy because you couldn't you couldn't you had to just like with the Legacy Media you had to collect people's opinion by mail or literally by voice or by letters um written with a a quilt on you know and a scroll type of thing you know like slow um so you had to have representative democracy you couldn't have direct democracy but my recommendation for Mars would be that the people vote directly for anything and that any given piece of legislation must be short enough to understand so like if if it's you know not not more than a thousand words maybe 300 the longer the legislation is the worse it gets and and we've got legislation that's longer than Lord of the Rings and like nobody's read it you know and um really quick I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you're doing um I see you and I see your heart and I know that you love Humanity not just America I do everything that you do it shows you care for everyone deeply thank you for that thank you I have a lot of ideas and if you want to hear them sometime we can sit down for dinner thank you thank you all right hello uh Elon my name is Steven Maro I live in Lancaster County it's nice to meet you um you once said in a job interview that uh when when when asked what is your biggest weakness you said um honesty which I find really interesting and the guy said well that's not a weakness and what I find fascinating is the way you stand up um to anybody and speak your mind and my question is there's a cost to telling the truth there's a cost to being honest yes and you're not afraid to pay that well it's not like fatal you know yeah and I think that um I'm wondering like where that came from in your life because you know you're an amazing inspiration with everything yeah I can I can totally tell you so like what it's I mean first of all you know like I think I I I aspire to be honest but I I'm also sometimes wrong um so obviously U you know can be right all the time um so and I I I do believe in in like um you know one should stand to be corrected um and uh the the the reason I believe in sort of Truth and honesty is because I'm like I'm trying to understand the universe I'm trying to understand reality um you know we trying to understand like what's the meaning of life like what are we here for like what's what's going on um and uh if you don't uh aspired to to truth if if you're not like rigorous about truth and honesty then you're obviously going to live in Ed world you w understand you want understand the nature of reality you want understand so I just I'm just curious and I want to understand the nature of reality so and that's requires rigorous adherence to the truth I could also add thank you what I find fascinating too is like um you know for you to stand up and speak the truth about what you feel about Trump I there's so many um celebrities that the other side has and yeah that's weird that there's so many celebrities you know I'm like like what are they what's up with that yeah exactly you're you're the only guy with a serious amount of influence that's able to really stand up for Trump and I really think that I know people that are like on the fence that are going to Trump because of you so I think great you are making a massive difference in this election like you single-handedly and that's an amazing Legacy amongst all the other things that you do so thank you well I I I'm trying I'm trying my best to to you know I I want to I'm trying to make as big a difference as possible um and uh yeah I mean I I do think like we we we're at a like I said a folk in the road of Destiny um where um you know like it's yeah like it's not clear to me that that that there will be elections after this if Trump Is Not Elected you know so the I mean there's basically in my opinion uh there's massive voter importation to swing states that is happening right now if you look at the actual numbers as reported by the Democrat Administration um there are triple digit increases in the number of illegals in each swing state it's 240% was the number I saw in Pennsylvania in three years and like that's you know if if the margin of Victory is like was 880,000 votes last time well what happens if you bring in like 300,000 illegals who are beholden to the Democrat machine and get a whole bunch of handouts um and that even though they may socially not be in agreement with the Democrats the their first order priority is bringing friends and family into the country which will be supported by the Democrats but not by the rep Republicans so it's it's voter importation is what's going on um and it doesn't take much to have the swing States uh be a permanent deep blue that's what happened in California so like like I love Reagan but he did sign in 1986 an amnesty uh that you know sort ofal alien amnesty that thereafter um California which had been red or a swing state but primarily red was went blue and then deep blue and now California passed a law Banning voter ID in any election whatsoever even in a Town Council that's what they will do to the whole country they the The Playbook is obvious because we could just look at what they did in California they're going to do the same thing in Pennsylvania same thing the whole rest of the country if they can and Trump is the only chance to have that not be the case and I and I'll tell you it's I'll tell you it's even it's cuz people like I think it's going to be worse than California because the one thing that keeps California from being even more crazy than it currently is is that people can move to other states and still be in America but what if you can't move to any other state it's going to be way worse than California so it's profound what's your favorite basball team Yankees well sorry okay listen I like the name okay it's a great name sorry sorry sorry ah what have I done uh hi Elon uh my name is David and I am an uh founder of an e-commerce company here in Lancaster Pennsylvania and uh I appreciate the one thing that you saying about the IRS uh being bullying the American citizens um uh instead of enforcing our border we're doing that um and I found one problem uh being a business owner is I have been the subject of uh recent harassment by the IRS and uh I find that being a huge discouragement to entrepreneurship which is the American backbone sure um and I wanted to know what you what would be one of the number one things you would recommend to the Trump Administration about encouraging entrepreneurship and getting uh young people especially encouraged into starting small businesses to keep our econom economy flourishing and to keep creating wonderful things like you have done yeah well I mean I it's really I think you know if we can just get the government off people's backs come on now then you can you can get a tremendous amount done and you know it's like just we're over regulating six way of Sunday as you've experienced yourself and then even when there's like a little bit of success then the governor comes along and takes the money so it's crazy you know so just when when if the founders of the country could see like where we are now they'd blow their mind you know like there was a a revolt against the British I think it was like a 2% tax on tea like say a 3% tax on T I'm like they're like no way and now it's like you know 40% I mean it's just like there's new taxes every day um and there's a lot of hidden taxes that you experience as a as a small business owner that people don't even realize exist you know you sort of come to realize that because IRS comes after you but there's there's a ton of taxes they try to sort of mask from the consumers so we just need smaller government um and and allow people to produce useful goods and services for their fellow human beings yeah it's straightforward hi Elon uh my name is Will King it's nice to meet you welcome to Lancaster thank you um I'm a young mechanical engineer I'm excited to work on new problems one of my dreams would be to work for one of your companies so we'll see where that goes but question I have is what are your thoughts on tariffs and how do you see tariffs impacting consumer spending or increasing inflation and what problems need to be solved for us production to reach is scill and efficiency that would match current outsourced production like obviously it's it's no first princip it's not a first princip principles problem we can do it but what needs to happen to in order for that to um well what are your thoughts on the subject so I think what you were what you were touching on before a lot of um government uh regulation yeah and uh taxes well taxes you know I don't know where we need to go with that but I think uh uh I love your uh philosophy of um surges in in in the employment and going hardcore um you know I was reading your autobiography the other or not your biography the other biography yeah yeah to be clear this it's it's it's a pretty good biography but it's not it's not actually what I would have written right but what really stood out to me I was reading uh about how you wanted to move the servers from uh Twitter up to is it in Oregon and well yeah actually there was yeah there there were three data centers only two were needed um and uh I was being told it would take like 9 months to right and you showed up with your guys and you like hey let's just do this overnight like Christmas so I think yeah Christmas Eve yeah cutting cutting down some of those regulations and all this crazy stuff that goes that uh extends the timeline for a bunch of stuff um would really would really help and that that worth e worth e work ethic I agree with your 80h hour work principle work week principle and the hardcore it's it's not for everyone you know everyone but I think the the principle is really cool and um I think we should bring that culture and that mindset down to the 40-hour work week or the 50 I do 50 but you know work life balance potentially but um I love where you're taking your companies and it's it's really cool to see well thanks thank you yeah go ahead hello Elon nice to see you here tonight uh so recently I was reading an article on medium uh where a Italian researcher named on Andrea Rossi was able to demonstrate a new technology that he invented that was able to extend the range of an electric vehicle it was a uh technically like a quad recycle so very low power electric vehicle by four times and after the the full test it had actually increased the battery life of the electric vehicle and um obviously you know we don't it's only been demonstrated at once we don't know if this technology could be replicated but if it was able to be replicated would you be interested in implementing this kind of Technology into your Tesla vehicles and even possibly the Starship well I I wish such a thing were were were real but I do not think that such a thing is real um that there is um you know every industry has a certain amount of of BS uh but the the battery industry I think might is a candidate for industry with the most amount of BS um so it's it's just there's like electrochemistry is very difficult in fact one of the ways that I will test like the intelligence of an AI system is to ask it battery electrochemistry questions and Rocket questions and usually comes back with terrible answers um so it's it's it's it's extremely difficult to increase the range but but the range is already sufficient to fully Electrify everything on Earth um so you know Tes have over 300 miles of range and some of them have like 400 miles of range we we could actually make it go further it's it's just that that's like an unnecessary amount of battery for most people um because the amount the amount of range that you need in a battery is about um the same amount of range that your bladder has essentially um so if you know if you start a trip at say 9 a.m. around noon you want to probably hit the restroom take a break you know have a bite to eat um and uh you know so you drive for 3 hours maybe four hours and then charge the car as long as the car is charged by the time you come back from the bathroom and you know had lunch or whatever then it it long-distance trips are no problem so we're already we already there at this point um so yeah um but but there there is no magical breakthrough um the would you also be willing if other Technologies are discovered over the next few years into the near future would you also be willing to that theoretically could revolutionize electrical vehicles um space travel you know exotic propulsion exotic energy generation techniques are you interested in researching those and potentially funding them and contributing to this kind of research I do think there is a lot of Technology out there that is not really mainstream that it has potential although it's in a very infantile stage I think there is potential I mean not only I mean I'm both Tesla and SpaceX are desperately interested in anything that works we're not like barring the door we're like please if you got something at Works tell us about it unfortunately it's rarely the case that it actually works is the issue um so um you know for a while there at Tesla I guess we maybe still do like we're just would rate any given you know proposed new technology out of 10 where 10 is is incredible um and you know one is total total nonsense and really nothing got above a four so it's it's just very difficult to do um but if if and I would encourage anyone to say prove me wrong please do that um I would like to be proven wrong that would be awesome uh on yeah but just just compete with Tesla that sounds like a great if you know if there's a some technology that has much greater range I would strongly recommend they just kick our ass you know yeah Elon do you believe that Jesus the Christ is a real person who was crucified and died and is risen and that God is Jesus what do you mean by a real person uh that he was alive back 200 years ago and he was the guy who was crucified okay cool yeah no I think those yeah I do think that's that's true yeah okay yeah yeah I mean you get into like these you know uh Theocratic debates of the Trinity and but I thought you know but yeah yeah I think it's real so U hi Elon that feels very weird to say but hi my name is Chris Michaelson I'm a Lancaster County resident we're really happy to have you here go baby thank you everybody look I like many of us here feel that the very construct the constitution of our country is at stake during this election I agree I'm a firm believer that those who can should and I just want to say thank you for being one of the very few powerful members outside of the construct who have the balls to stand up here every day and do what you're doing thank you thank you thanks all right there's a Macho Man's here uh look president Trump has announced you or has announced that he will appoint you as the head of the efficiency commission right right that's obviously a perfect spot for you given your historical success running lean and exceptionally profitable businesses one of my big concerns that extends beyond the disarray of our financial Constitution here is the technology attacks that have happened on our country 2021 the colonial pipeline ransomware attack yeah 2021 Robin Hood 7 million users data stolen their money held for ransom 2023 T-Mobile goes down overnight uh airport attacks Airline attacks have you spoken to Trump at all regarding your expertise around cyber security are you going to have any involvement there if not do you know who is and do you trust them and then have one more question well I I I definitely I certainly don't have all the answers here um and and I don't I don't want to tempt fate but like nobody has successfully hacked SpaceX or starlink and there've been every day there are thousands of attempts uh to hack starlink and no one has succeeded um again I don't want to attempt fate here so this is not a attempt I'm not saying to hacker groups out there please hack starlink like please don't hack starlink uh but but thus far there' have been many attempts by individuals and state actors to hack into starlink and none of them have been successful so track record thus far is pretty good um no one has successfully hacked into yeah so far so good you know don't want to be complacent or anything um no no one has hacked into the Tesla Mothership like the the T the Tesla core database many people have tried to hack into the Tesla core database zero successes yeah I I can certainly say like now now government computers are not super secure uh because it's the government you know uh so it's like if you say like what is an easy H thing to hack I say well govern computers are easy thing to hack um so it's not good no I agree um that's why I like I I I'm you know I'm like as a hardcore technology guy I'm saying we should not have voting machines we should not have computers uh cuz they two subject to being hacked by by and it's like they subject being hacked by you know and the people protecting these machines don't understand technology and and they could easily be Bamboozled so even with the best of intentions so but it's really hard to bamboozle paper ballots uh in person with ID which is obviously how it should be one more thing just real quick yeah we we've talked about baseball a couple times tonight my brother's handicapped Ryan I love you I'm sorry that you couldn't be here tonight he's a white socks fan and he is just wants to know if you would consider consider buying them and turning them into a reputable business thank you well I I I'm a technology guy so I'm I'm just you know I got to pick my battles here um so I'm I'm just I try to make technologies that people find useful thank you Elon thank you all right hi Elon my name is bladimir I'm an entrepreneur from Reading Pennsylvania I came all the way here to see you cuz I'm not sure if you're going to make it to in Pennsylvania I couldn't wait thank you so much for your contributions to the world thank you for Tesla neuralink SpaceX X everything that you're doing is incredible and thank you for stepping up with your leadership to uh once again try to take our country back thank you it's kind of yourself my question to you is regarding artificial intelligence probably your greatest invention hopefully not our last invention yeah you were really on the you were really advocating for basically regulating uh the advances that we're making on artificial intelligence how long do you think it would be before we actually reach AGI or artificial general intelligence and artificial super intelligence and are you still up for regulating this uh amazing invention that we've uh summoned here uh yes I mean I I I do think there should be some regulatory oversight for AI um so yeah I mean it's it's I kind of view Regulators as kind of like the referees in a sports game you know if you whether it's baseball basketball any any given sport uh uh all the teams want to have referees uh so that you know that teams don't break the rules and and there fair play so I think there there is a sort of a right number of regulators for any given industry um but there shouldn't be there shouldn't be too many or too few now there's basically no Regulators in AI right now so it's like having a game with no referees that's that's you know subject to something bad happening um so my recommendation would be to have uh yeah to have have an AI regulatory agency at the federal level um it should be you know not not heavy-handed it should be but there shouldn't be nothing um in contrast in other Industries there's excess regulation because these regulatory agencies have just sort of grown over time to the point where there are too many referees on the field I think the sports analogy makes a lot of sense like you want to have enough referees to have a fair game but not so many referees that people can't th can't throw a pass on the football field without hitting a ref you know that's that's the situation we got right now it's like you're trying to run downfield bam you just run bumping into refs everywhere so that's that you know we got to take some correct action there um so thank you all right Elon Musk it's a pleasure to meet you um this should be sponsored by Dr scholes I don't know how you're Feud are doing it right now I just want to say thank you for being here tonight it's an honor to be here with you I actually have been waiting for almost a decade to talk with you and ask you a few questions all right uh first one I want to just break right into business uh a friend of mine is building the world's brightest light in the world powered completely by renewable and Tesla solar panels and we want to know if you'll turn it on for us it's been cleared it's in Texas the FAA approved it will you turn it on for us potentially uh possibly okay when you say brightest light like what do you mean brighter than the luxer it'll hit the International Space Station and you can and illuminate it at night okay yes yeah it can light up the whole Grand Canyon as well that's what the engineers say Okay a hell of a light okay it is sure the solar panels too so okay great that sounds good uh secondly uh we we've heard a lot of prayers tonight I just want to say a quick prayer for you and ask everybody to join me um and just put your hands up and let's pray that God protects this man here he's risking his life his family and his future for people here in a country who he believes in and we believe in you Elon and thank you thank you for everything you're doing we ask God that he protects you and keeps you safe in your journey in protecting us in our country um thank you okay so my question my real question is uh you've done a ton of things you've literally enabled mankind to live amongst the Stars well not yet but we're almost we're getting there yes and I can I want to nerd out with you all day on this um the NASA has been you know touted that the fuel of the stars is hydrogen I know I know before you kill me uh you're not a huge fan of hydrogen and I I understand it has its flaws but we do have some incredible successes and my question is for you if I were able to help you and provide you with the right people and resources would you be down to basically involve yourself with us and help save our planet uh well I I do have 17 jobs um and and with the Department of government efficiency 18 um so I you know I I have to be cautious about taking on additional responsibility uh because it's just physically impossible um but uh yeah I mean the the the biggest source of energy by far is the Sun so nothing even comes close to uh the sun in terms of energy output um the sun converts over 4 million tons of mass energy per second and it's been doing that for a very long time and we'll do that for many many billions of years to come so one of the ways you can think of of the progress of Any Given civilization is on the cev scale and so just simple way of thinking about it is uh you're CAU of level one if you've harnessed all the power of a of a planet uh your two if you've harnessed all the power of a solar system and your uh three if you've harness the power of a galaxy we're very far from three it's safe to say but even from one um so when when you think in CER terms it becomes very obvious that the sun is overwhelming the source of energy and everything else is Tiny potatoes tiny tiny tiny potatoes but hey we we tiny potatoes are fine for now but um but the sun is overwhelmingly the Big Potato the humongous potato so it's really hesting the power of the Sun that uh will lead us to the Stars hi hi Elon uh Dave from Lancaster County uh first thank you so much for all the Insight this evening um and thought-provoking conversation uh two questions one with slightly more than nine days until the election what would you recommend as a 30 second Pitch to convince somebody not to believe what they're seeing on CBS NBC and ABC oh I've got a a great solution for that which is send them Links of to uh videos and information on the xplatform so if they say that you know Trump loves Nazis for example like well actually here's the whole speech where he categorically condemns Nazis um and yet the Democrats keep claiming that he loves Nazis uh even though he specifically said he condemns them in the strongest possible terms uh they still perpetuate the fine people hoax yes you know it's it's pretty insane um so for any given thing that somebody says well Trump is this or that just send them the actual speech that's the that's the antidote send what he actually said Thank you and then the second part xplatform actually has that so you know that's that's the best [Applause] way hey Elon um John Scott your old classmate from upen says hi okay cool um thanks for a great earnings call on Wednesday you're welcome um my name is Raphael Aziz I'm a Coptic Orthodox Christian immigrant from Alexandria Egypt I have lived through religious persecution before and I believe that the liberal and the woke movement is a religious persecution today it is anti-christian and quite honestly anti-religion you have posted on X that unless there is more bravery to stand up for what is fair and right Christianity will perish my question to you Elon Musk is very simple will you stand with the Coptic Christian Community our brothers and sisters the Catholic and Christians and the Protestant evangelicals against the liberal movement that that is trying to destroy Christianity and religion in America yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm against I'm against the the the the the W woke religion is is is fundamentally an extinctionist uh belief system it's an extinctionist belief system um and I think we we want to have we want to be expansionists we want to expand to the stars um we want to grow as a civilization we don't want to go extinct and uh so yeah I absolutely support the Copic Christians and and like I mean really anyone who's like expansionist who's who's believes in in in a a future that is better than the past that in a future where we grow um I'm I massively support that so all right hi Elon uh I'm Jeremy and I'm from Earth more more specifically Bowmanville yeah but um my question is address one astronomical unit can you give some insight into your decisionmaking process and worldview I mean I have a lot of respect for what you've been able to accomplish so far and you have a huge vision for what you want to accomplish so yet and in that way there's a crossover between the areas that you're a subject expert in and politics so if you have some insight into how you make decisions and your world viiew then that enables us all to trust you across a larger amount of issues sure well you know um I'm a big believer in physics you know which is uh like basically if if you like I mean I sort of say like you know uh everything everything else is a recommendation pretty much but physics is the law like if you break physics you're going to it's not going to the rocket will explode uh and the car will not work so you have to adhere to physics in order to make cars that work and to make rockets that work in order to make space internet that works um you you because if you're wrong then reality is a very harsh judge it reality is merciless uh if you make a advice that doesn't work that that violates physics it simply doesn't work and then you'll think rocket blows up and the satellites don't work and the cars break so you either you either if you make technology you either have a rigorous you you you you you have to in order to make technology work you must have extremely rigorous pursuit of the truth because otherwise reality will bite you on the ass big time yeah so all right hian thank you for taking taking the time to be with us today my name is Justin Henson also Lancaster County native uh my generation is inheriting housing shortage and we're statistically less likely to take blueco collar jobs obviously declining birth rates been discussed there's not going to be as many people to even fill blueco collar jobs um what do you think the solution is to the current housing crisis that we're having in this country in terms of pricing it seems like my generation is getting priced out of homes but also balancing the equity that people who currently own their homes have and obvious not wanting to destroy that as well what do you see there to be a solution to that problem well I mean the risk of being repetitive I think regulation is uh Strangling progress I there's so many regulations you know you can't even like modify your kitchen or you know add add something to your house without getting as zli in permits so if we get if we reduce regulation you reduce the cost of of new houses um so so yeah I mean it's it's you know if I know there's like many small business owners and um and builders in this audience and and who are listening and anyone who has tried to build things uh whether it's you know build build build a house or do anything build a business you you you realize just how much of a government burden there is it's it's massive um and uh there's a state burden as well as a federal burden but we can at least do something about the federal burden and then you know that that's you know at least we could we don't have to have like 400 how many agencies there are this is so crazy you know more like I'd like to know if this is there I bet there's not a single member of Congress that can name 200 agencies I'd be surprised um so how many agencies do we need 99 that sounds like a lot it sounds planning to cover the bases how many bases do we need to cover anyway 99 bases sounds like a lot um so anyway I think we we we could uh just get the government over people's backs would be a big Improvement in quality of life and cost of housing and everything else yes Elon what's going on Big Dog hey how's it going um it's it's a pleasure to meet you U my name is Nathan I'm from Columbia anyways so um I was going to ask how's it feel to be the richest man in the world and uh also kind of get a picture with you real quick well we're on TV right now so I think I think actually the we're we're both uh live streaming right now I think probably to millions of people actually so uh yeah so Millions people I think millions of people will actually see us uh we're now on screen for millions of people um in terms of how does it feel I mean it's it's kind of a strange thing because uh I guess like I'm still very much like a technologist who like you know I just work a lot you know um and then my recreational activity is uh hanging out with friends and family and playing video games which is yeah exactly I play video G Diablo or other video games um so um you know it's like I don't I don't have like any Yachts or Holiday Homes or anything um so I guess if I was to maybe live a more hedonistic life and and you know had like yachts and Islands or something like that then would make more I I maybe that would be more I don't know but that's not my idea of fun though because I like I'm like you know I'm sitting if I go and sit on the beach then I'm like this is boring know what I'm supposed to do now you know so I I I just like building things and uh I like being being productive and doing useful things and making cool products and um that's it pretty much I mean I also do like hanging out with friends and family and stuff but uh you know I'm not like saying how can I sort of buer v a yard out or anything like I don't have a boat or anything like that so um of I still love you yeah of course I still love it yeah you're right I do have boats what are you talking of course yes there's a boat Bo we we SpaceX has these uh ships that are uh for the rocket lands on you know um so I guess technically I do own boats yeah so I stand corrected thank you um yeah maybe I should like go sort of sailing around in one of them or something yeah yeah all right hi Elon my name is Bruce I'm a voter here in Pennsylvania and it's really it is an honor to meet you you've been a very strong inspiration for me in my family and all my friends so God bless you for that I have a question right now about Latin America you've obviously met president na Salvador who has done an incredible job he's a very smart guy oh absolutely absolutely like it's it's like we like you know we had a long conversation U about many subjects um I think uh yeah he's really sharp guy absolutely so following on that what would you advocate for in a second Trump Administration to incentivize States like Mexico Ecuador and others into strengthening their policies on policing and economic opportunities to stem the tide of illegal migration to the US Southern border thank you yeah well I mean if there's prosperity in in those countries then I think there would obviously be less of a forcing function for legal migration um it's it's pretty tough uh you know um I mean and there's some lessons to be learned there like when when Travis came to power in Venezuela one of the first things he did was take the guns away from people so he he basically banned private gun ownership um under the guise of you know safety uh and uh and then Maduro when he had the election recently he lost by a landslide and just ignored the election and people protested and they got shot they couldn't defend themselves that's why you need the Second Amendment it's a critical thing so so I I I I think I think it's worth looking at US policies and saying you know which of these policies are actually helping other countries um and uh you know like we s a lot of money to various countries but I'm like does it do any good I don't know um I think we should just do a thought review of of like um you know do our actions actually help these countries and uh why are we sending them our money again and and and do the American people like if we're sending people's tax money to other countries is it actually make sense like are we Act is it doing good uh can it be defended to the American public or or not and if it can't then I think we should probably stop sending money or send less um and uh or send less um and uh so I'm more of a fan of the sort of Monro or send less um and uh so cool here you know yeah or send less um and uh we'll be cool here you know what impact will happen or send less um and uh 11 and our question is what impact will happen or send less um and uh going to come for me big time or send less um and uh from their standpoint pretty high on the list um or send less um and uh from their standpoint pretty high on the or send less um and uh um or send less um and uh man I think we just got to make sure Trump wins or send less um and uh it's just it's just got to happen you know or send less um and uh it's just it's just got to happen you know money or send less um and uh I I don't want to be in politics I I I like to be in or send less um and uh this time we're we're at a Crossroads that could be was or send less um and uh say you know uh you know where or send less um and uh say you know uh or send less um and uh be a hard time just just keep at it or send less um and uh all right hey on my name is Alex gan from York or send less um and uh D team uh many don't realize that for people ages five or send less um and uh D team many don't R for four hours uh or send less um and uh today my Tesla drove me for four hours uh or send less um and uh to me from driveway to parking lot and then uh after or send less um and uh from driveway to parallel park on the street or send less um and uh that's cool from driveway to parallel the Cyber truck obviously looks unus or send less um and uh that because yeah I mean the Cyber truck obviously looks unusual or send less um and uh I think they're they're they look great but they they look they look Somey or send less um and uh I think this it's kind of like if let's say you've got or send less um and uh so this it's kind of like if let's say you've got boot or send less um and uh sitting on the couch and it looks like a cat but it's actually puss and boots or send less um and uh you know that's that's what what Teslas are they look like a normal car but they're M or send less um and uh yeah so this while I got toen cat I was like but unless money or send less um and uh yeah so this why to make that aware about the the nationaly or send less um and uh I I just wanted to say just you know to make that aware about the the national or send less um and uh economic benefits but um but I just want or send less um every year in the world from accidents and number could be% uh yeah we should adver we do advertise a little bit um but yeah I don't know I guess I do get asked about advertising a lot all right I think probably more questions and thenight go ahead good evening sir I just had a question I thinkle underated and this the actual risk of nuclear power is very l so in fact it's possible withern designs to make reives so you make nule super sa and I think we should should have more power like I said long that giant Fusion reactor Sun you that is so overwhelmingly the biggest source of energy everything else is by comparon vision is FAS but overwhel just just do the math very forward the sun isting Milli mass energy that is a staggering am that's that's [Applause] St suit so my question is since you bought Twitter and transformed it into X much has changed on the platform like little censorship um social media plays and interal role in American society do you have any plans any more plans for X to expand its use and influence if so what are they also do you have future plans on buying other large platforms like YouTube it's possible to BU Facebook so now I think the fact that the xform is fre spech platform has caused the others to move more in that direction because then they're like you know it's likeone sing in the same dun people can find out the actually you only need one platform to step out line and stoping and all the other Andor much less so influence is much greater than just what we do on next platform because the rest of also and and the rule is simple for X is we we want to follow the law of the land and if the people have different laws they but otherwise simply tonight I'm AAL health professional in Bur County which is a neighbor County live in Lan often diagn children syndrome IES re gives them I'm curious to know if you're willing you are currently speaking in advocacy or people because if you look at the statistics in the United States unemployment and underemployment even ined individuals who are college graduates is to you know I think having some sort of you know element like that does result in an increas to the truth or try to understand the nature reality and somee I'm not sure what say anything think would be helpful for example king of we have an agency called the neury are individuals are much less likely to steal they're very conscientious about but's IGN reason individual who have successful Lives who were able to say to these families that your children will grow up and have successful lives as we able ofet I feel like if you would speak up more for example look at me at what able to again entrepreneur answer their to answer and they start you know nobody Inu think that as we create a robot will a l they will have will and like have son whatever not hard easy like that be like R2 [Applause] my name is Josh I'm from here in Lan and5 around the buies it's part of the training data my question is Elon as someone deeply committed to uncovering truth could you share the methods you rely on to identify objective truth in addition to the crowdsource community notes on X in other words can you describe your preferred epistemological framework and perhaps hint how these philosophical underpinnings will continue to enable AI X as well as inform policy for our country yeah I so like I really would recommend people study Physics honestly uh you know if you're trying to understand how the physical world works that's what physics is physics is simply an attempt to understand the rules that govern reality like what rules are good predict in the future and what rules are not so I try I try to as much as possible and evaluate what I learned against what I believe to be most fundamental TR reality thens based new data it's like as I learned like I try to change my mind if there is reason to change my mind it's kindal to want to be sit want to be ways and convinced that they're right whereas you know I think to be less wrong L wrong yeah exactly so I that isort of how things operate in physics like the it's not the most you know G sort of slog that's wrong it's like but but if you want to be that wrong then you should that's a good operating principle is yeah speak the truth and and and and let the conclusions lead where you yeah I me like this is it's very it's very important to operate on princi your building internet or you know rockus because if you don't there not Rous understanding of how reality works the Rockets blow up and the cars work be that's easy answer but I just if you want to be that you should asire anyway [Applause] else and remember what I said at the beginning which is is that there are actually 40,000 ballots that people have that have actually not been mailed in or not been submitted and uh you can actually go in person on Monday and and vote and please do and please enourage everyone you know to do the same thank [Applause] [Music] you e
