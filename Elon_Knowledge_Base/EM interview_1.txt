build a relationship build a rapport so that when it's time for them to get you know interviewed or whatever there's a so you must see a lot of people just give us a state of politicians post this current batch what is the same very optimistic okay is it getting worse yeah it's getting worse because of Instagram and AOC that kind of person yes her specifically but not just her um I say more they they want these are congressional [Laughter] Kardashians can I tell you something my experience in the news business dealing with politicians leads me to believe that the people in this room and on this stage over your two-day conference are the people we need to be looking to for our future leaders and ideas and to save the country it's not Washington DC all the incentives to be a good person are gone it's not that there aren't any good ones there's there definitely are and there's some you know true Patriots who are still trying to serve and even who who are two people just on on either side that you would just tell us to look out for or even they are already doing the job where you say these two people are like good people you should play the little Jeopardy music right now um no one's coming to mind off the top of my head but I know that there are some uh look I like Rand Paul I think Rand Paul is a good and honest man don't run a giant deficit it's not a bad philosophy all of them lie so I'm not trying to excuse all of that they all do but if you watch people long enough you find the ones that stand up for the right issues and seem to have some integrity that's one that comes to mind I there used to be a day where they where they would reach across the aisle and they actually weren't just there for clicks or to make themselves famous or and those days are few and far between now I just think with look I supported the Supreme Court's decision in citizen United and I think big money in politics was always going to happen but it's corrupted the system in a way that you know most politicians only have to answer to their one group of big donors or their one small constituency and their one very red or very blue town and there's no more incentive to compromise there's only incentive to get reelected which is one of the frustrations we have when we watch Washington nothing gets done or size of relief in this Congress where we watch Washington and nothing gets done right right now I'm all about going back to the original founding version of this country where government was as small as possible the presidency was as small as possible and these people do as little as humanly possible while they're in office I feel Megan I feel like someone should do like a modernday recap of the Federalist Papers like an understanding of the basis of the foundation of the Republic like were what were the founding philosophies and how and then understanding how far astray we we've gone but let me ask you a question what constitutional amendments would you pass to fix the incentive problems if you could have your brothers pass any Constitutional Amendment or two what would they be to address the incentive issue that's causing a lot of the integrity and misalignment problem I don't think it it starts like that I think it it is just like kamla Harris's Choice as Biden's uh replacement it's bottom up it's bottom up that's the LIE remember they told us Chuck Schumer it's bottom up we chose the people chose her literally nobody's for her to be the nominee um I think this one does have to be bottom up like if we're going to change the way we elect politicians and the way we govern ourselves you know we're so it's so much more complex than just what what laws are written down and you attack has a lot to do with it how divided we are how disconnected we are how lonely we are I mean right now the latest strain of the argument is interesting which is all the processed foods are making us weird and unhealthy and dying and and dividing people further because it's driving our hormones nuts and our behavior is getting weirder and obese yeah and obesity so I mean there's just a lot we need to reconsider about the way we're living and I do think one of the main things is we need to see each other again we need to like look at at each other in the eye across from the table we need to ban our kids from playing on the devices when they get together for play dates totally we must insist that they play outside without any devices and actually connect with nature we must make sure that they do the same we must get out of the coastal cities and go to fly over country and go to a rodeo in Montana something like that you know I we all we have to start loving our country again that's a huge piece of it and that again is community you know speaking of rodeo and Montana we went we go out there we have a little ski Cab in there which we love and uh we went in the summer brought our kids to a rodeo they started playing the national anthem and my little guy at the time was like five and he was a little slow to get up right like he knows to get up but he was five and there's this old cowboy sitting right behind us with the big hat and the jeans and the belt and he goes boy you better get on your feet and my son was like oh [ __ ] yes sir that was me but I was like right on that's great right on that's what we need right like more of that and more of looking out for one another not with forced taxes and through the eyeballs and all that nonsense but like your neighbor's sick go make him a casserole your old older neighbor is housebound go moh her lawn that is the stuff that used to make us us and as we just Retreat into our devices and our television screens and all of it we lose that and we lose us all right well said ladies and gentlemen Megan [Music] Kelly thank you whoa standing out that was awesome really awesome [Music] [Applause] after buying Twitter for $44 billion must time as CEO has been a whirlwind shares of must other major company Tesla have plummeted more than 30% since he took over Twitter as is often the case his next move is unclear I go far to say that he's demonstrating some erratic Behavior go [ __ ] yourself is that clear I hope it is hey Bob here in the audience Elon musk's cooperation Andor relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at the Biden Administration has just announced its second investigation in the Elon Musk in less than a week both the Tesla and SpaceX there's a product road map that they're on and that whether Elon is in the building or not is not going to impact the plan that they have people said he'd never get the rocket in space he did that people said the road here would never get delivered he did that people said he'd never get a hundred of them done he's got 200 done as an entrepreneur you can't listen to the noise and you certainly can't just man but the world's first trillionaire Elon basically has had over the last 10 or 15 years an incredible amount of challenges that he's overcome probably had to deal with stuff that most of us would have broken under and he just fought through it and the guy just basically bended all the haters until he crushed their souls and I just think that that's incredible [Music] all right the greatest entrepreneur generation Elon Musk hey guys my stuff sit there I'm going to yep I'm going to take this all right do this thanks for taking the time ah how um how you doing brother you keeping busy yeah I mean it's rarely a slow week I mean in the world as well yeah it I mean any given week I it just seems like the things get nuttier it it it's definitely a simulation we've agreed on this at this point I mean well like if if we are in some alien Netflix series I think the ratings are high yes are um how are the um uh the the freedom of speech Wars going um this is a uh we you've been you've been at War for two years now yes uh the price of freedom of speech is not cheap is it I think it's like 44 billion something like that just numbers give her give or take a billion yeah R numers yeah yeah um it's uh it's it's pretty nutty there there is like this weird movement to uh quell Free Speech uh kind of around the world and um and this is something we should be very concerned about uh you know you have to ask like why was the first amendment like a high priority you was like number one um number one is because uh people came from countries where if you spoke freely you would be imprisoned or killed and they were like well we would like to not have that here um cuz that was terrible and and actually you know there's a lot of places in the world right now if you if you're critical of the government uh you get in prisoned or killed right yeah and we'd like to not have that are you to that I mean I suspect this is a receptive audience to that message [Applause] um you I I think we always thought that the West Was the exception to that that we knew there were authoritarian places around the world but we thought that in the west we'd have freedom of speech and we've seen like you said it seems like a global movement in Britain you've got teenagers being put in prison for memes yesing it's like you like to you like to Facebook post throw them in the prison yeah people have got an actual you know prison for for like like obscure comments on social media not even posting like not even yeah pble got thrown in prison recently I'm like that was pretty about I was like what is the massive crime that right pav in France and then of course we got Brazil with judge Voldemort that that one seems like the one that impacts you the most can you what's the latest on that well we I guess we are trying to figure out uh is there some reasonable solution in Brazil uh the you know the concern uh I mean I want to just make sure that this is framed correctly um and uh you know funny memes aside I the the the nature of the concern was that at least at at excorp we had the perception that U we were being asked to do things that violated Brazilian law so obviously we cannot as an American company impose American laws and values on on other countries um that uh you know we wouldn't get very far if we did that um but but we do you know think that uh if if a country's law laws are a particular way and we're being asked to what we we think we think we're being asked to break them then and and be silent about it then obviously that is no good so so I just want to be clear the sometime some comes across as uh elon's trying to just be a crazy whatever billionaire and demand outrageous things from other countries and um you know while that is true um in addition there are um other things uh that that I think are you know valid which is like we we we obviously can't uh you know I think any given thing that we do at exor we've got to be able to explain in the light of day and and not feel that it was dishonorable or you know we we we did the wrong thing you know uh so we don't we that that that that was the that that's the nature of the concern so we actually are in uh sort of discussions with uh the you know judicial authorities in Brazil to try to you know run this to ground like uh what What's actually going on like if if we're being asked to break the law Brazilian law then that's that that obviously should not be should not sit well with the Brazilian Judiciary and if we're not and we're mistaken we'd like to understand how we are mistaken I think that's a that's a pretty reasonable uh position I'm a bit concerned as your friend that you're going to go to one of these countries and I'm going to wake up one day and you're going to get arrested and like I'm going to have to go bail you out or something like this is feels very acute like yes I mean it's not a joke now like they're literally saying like you know it's not just Biden saying like we have to look into that guy now it's become quite literal like this I who was the guy who just wrote the um was it the guardian piece about like oh yeah yeah there have been three articles and I think in the past three weeks Robert Reich but it wasn't just him it was like articles three different articles that doesn't that's a trend calling for me to be imprisoned right in in the guardian you know guardian of what what are they protecting exactly yeah guardian of I don't know authoritarianism yeah guardian of yeah censorship censorship but but the premise here is that you bought this thing this online Forum this communication platform and you're allowing people to use it it to express themselves therefore you have to be jailed I don't understand the logic here right um there's what do you think they're actually afraid of at this point what's the motivation here I mean I think the if somebody's a if somebody's sort of trying to push a false premise on the world then and then that that and that premise can be undermined with public dialogue then they will be opposed to public Dialogue on that premise because they wish that false premise to Prevail right um so that's I think you know the the issue there is uh if they don't like the truth you know then we want to suppress it so now the you know the the sort of the what what we're trying to do with X Corp uh is uh I distinguish that from my son who's also called X yes uh you have you have parental goals and go everything's just called X basically very difficult disambiguation the sun yeah it's X everything um so uh what we're trying to do simply adhere to the uh you know the the laws in a in a country um so so if something is illegal in the United States or if it's illegal in you know Europe or Brazil or or wherever it might be uh then then we will take it down or we'll suspend the account because we we're not you know there to make the laws we but but if speech is not illegal then then what are we doing okay now we're injecting ourselves in as as a sensor and and where does it stop and who decides so and where where does that path lead I think it leads to a bad place uh so if the people if in a country want the laws to be different they should make the laws different but otherwise we're going to obey the law in each jurisdiction right and some of these Europe that's it it's it's not more complicated that we're not we're not trying to FL out the law I'm be clear about that but we're trying to adhere to the law and if the laws change we will change and if if the laws don't change we we won't we're just literally trying to adhere to the law it's pretty pretty straightforward there some Europe very straightforward if somebody doesn't thinks we're not adhering to the law well they can file a lawsuit Mingo also very straightforward yes I mean there are European countries that don't want people to promote Nazi propaganda yes they have some sensitivity to it well it's it is illegal it is illegal in those countries in those countries if somebody puts that up you take it down yes yeah but they typically file something and say te down and no in some cases it is just um obviously illegal like you don't need to file a lawsuit for you know if something is just you know unequivocally illegal we can literally read the law this violates the law you know anyone anyone can see that like you know you don't need like if if somebody is stealing you don't need let me check the LA on that okay oh no they're they're steing Francisco let's talk so we had we had JD Vance here this morning he did a great job um and you know one of the things is there's this image on X of like basically like you Bobby uh Trump and JD are like the Avengers I guess and then there's another meme where you're in front of a desk where it says d o g the department of governmental efficiency yes yes I posted that one tell us about I I made it using grock the gro image generator and I posted it tell us about print it to my profile seek for efficiency um how how do you do it well I I mean I I think with great difficulty uh but you know look it's been a long time since there was a serious effort to reduce the size of government and to um remove absurd regulations yeah and you know the last time there was a really concerted effort on that front was Reagan in the early 80s we're 40 years away from um a a a a serious effort to remove um you know not regulations that don't serve the greater good and and reduce the size of government and I think it's just if we don't do that then what's what what's happening is that we get regulations and laws accumulating every year until eventually everything's illegal uh and that's why we can't get uh major infrastructure projects done in the United States like if you look at the absurdity of the California highspeed rail I think they theyve spent $7 billion and have A600 put segment that doesn't actually have rail in it I mean your tax dollars at work I mean yeah what are we doing that's an expensive 1,600 ft of concrete you know um and and I mean I think it's like if you know uh I realize sometimes I'm perhaps a little optimistic with schedules but uh you know I mean I wouldn't be doing the things I'm doing if I was uh you know not an an optimist uh so but but but but at the current Trend you know California high speet roil might finish sometime next Century maybe probably not we're just we'll have teleportation by that time so yeah exactly have ai do everything that point so so so so you I think you really think of um you know the the United States and many countries it's it's arguably worse than the EU as being like guliver tied down by a million little strings and like any one given regulation is not is not that bad but you've got a million of them and um or Millions actually and and and then eventually you just can't get anything done and uh and this is a this is a massive tax on the on the consumer on the people uh it's just they don't they don't realize that there's this this massive tax in the form of irrational regulations um I'm going I'll give you a recent uh example that that you know is is just insane um is that uh like SpaceX was fined by the EPA $140,000 for um they claimed dumping uh portable water on the ground drinking water so and we're like uh this is at Star base and and we're like it's we're in a tropical uh thunderstorm region um that stuff comes from the sky all the time and um and there was no actual harm done you know it was just watered to cool the the the launch pad during uh liftoff and um there's zero harm done like they're like they agree yes there's zero home done we're like okay so there's no Home done and um but you want us to pay $140,000 fine it's like yes because you don't have a permit okay we didn't know there was a permit needed or zero h fresh water being on the ground in a place that where fresh water falls from the sky all the time it next to the ocean next next to the ocean cuz there's a little bit of water there too yeah I mean sometimes it rain so much the the roads are flooded so we're like you know how does this make any sense yeah and and then like then then they were like well we're not going to process any more of your any more of your applications for launch for Starship launch unless you pay this $140,000 they just ransomed us and we're like Okay so we paid $140,000 but it was a it's like this is no good I mean at this rate we're never going to get to Mars I mean that's the that's the confounding part here yeah is we're acting against our own self-interest you know when you look at we do have to make putting aside fresh water but hey you know there the rocket makes a lot of noise so I'm I'm certain there's some complaints about noise once in a while but sometimes you want to have a party where you want to make progress and there's a little bit of noise therefore you know we we trade off a little bit of noise for massive progress or even fun so like when did we stop being able to make those trade-offs but talk about the difference between California and Texas U where you and I now reside um Texas you were able to build the gigafactory I remember when you got the plot of land and then I it seemed like it was less than two years when you had the party to open it yeah from from St of construction um to completion uh was 14 months 14 14 months is there anywhere on the planet that would go faster is like China faster than that uh China was 11 months got it so Texas China 11 and 14 months California how many months and just to give you a sense of size the Tes of gigafactory in China is three times the size of the Pentagon which was the biggest building in America uh no there are bigger buildings but the pentagon's pretty big one yeah or it was the biggest in units in units of pentagon it's like three okay three pentagons and Counting yeah got it in 14 months um the just the just the regulatory approvals in California would have taken two years yeah so that's that's the issue where where do you think the regulation helps like for the people that will say we need some checks and balances we can't have some because for every good actor like you they'll be a bad actor so where is that line then yeah I mean I have a sort of an you know in in sort of doing said sensible deregulation and um reduction the size of government the is is just like be very public about it and say like which of these rules do you if the public is really excited about a rule and wants to keep it we'll just keep it and and here the thing about the rules if if like if the rule is um you know turns out to be a bad we'll just put it right back okay and then you know problem solved it's like it's easy to add rules but we don't actually have a process for getting rid of them that's the issue there's no garbage collection foru um when we were um watching you work David and I and Antonio um in that first month at Twitter which was all hands on deck and you were doing zerob based budgeting you really quickly got the cost under control and then miraculously everybody said this site will go down and you added 50 more features so maybe explain because this is the first time like so many articles like the that this this is Twitter is Dead Forever there's no way it could possibly even continue at all it was almost like the Press wasting for you to let's write the obit here has the orbituary uh they were all saying their goodbyes on Twitter remember that yeah yeah yeah they were all leaving and saying their goodbyes cuz the site was going to melt down and yeah totally fail and and uh all the journalists left yeah and which is it's if you ever want to like hang out with a bunch of Hall monitors oh my God threads is amazing every I go over there and post they're like they they're really triggered but yeah I mean if you like being condemned repeatedly then yes you know for reasons that make no sense then threads is the way to go yeah it's really it's it's the most miserable place on Earth if Disney's the happiest L is the anti- Disney but if we were to go into government you went into the Department of Education or pick the department you've worked with a lot of them actually sure you can't go in there in zerob based budget okay we get it but if you could just pair two three four five% of those organizations what kind of impact would that have yeah I mean I think we' need to do more than that I think ideally but compounding every year 2 3% a year I mean it would be better than what's happening now yeah I look I think we've we've um you know uh if if Trump wins and and obv say I suspect there are people people with mixed feelings about whether that should happen but uh but if but we do have an opportunity uh to do kind of a once in a-lifetime deregulation and reduction in the size of government um because because the other thing besides the regulations um America is also going bankrupt extremely quickly um and and nobody seems to everyone seems to be sort of whistling past the graveyard on this one um but they're all they're all grabbing the silverware everyone's stuff in their pockets with the silverware before this the Titanic sinks it's like well you know the the defense department budget is a very big budget okay it's a trillion dollars a year DOD Andel it's Trill a trillion dollars um and interest payments on the national debt just exceeded the defense department budget they're over a trillion dollars a year just in interest and Rising we're we're adding a trillion dollars to theet to our debt which our you know kids grandkids are going to have to pay somehow um you know every every 3 months and then student it's going to be every two months and then every month and then the only thing we'll be able to pay is interest and and if if this is it's just you know the it's just like a person at scale that has racked up too much credit card debt um and uh this this is not this does not have a good ending how so we we have to reduce the spending let me ask one question cuz I've brought this up a lot and the counterargument I hear which I disagree with um but the counter argument I hear from a lot of politicians is if we reduce spending because right now if you add up federal state and local government spending it's between 40 and 50% of GDP so nearly half of our economy is supported by government spending and nearly half of people in the United States are dependent directly or indirectly on government checks and and either through contractors that that the government pays or they're employed by government um entity so if you go in and you take too hard an acts too fast you will have significant contraction job loss and recession what's The Balancing Act Elon just thinking realistically because I'm 100% on board with you the steps the next set of steps however assume Trump wins and you become the the chief uh do um uh do uh how how like yeah and I think the challenge is how quickly can we yeah how quickly can we go in how quickly can things change and without without I that on my business card yeah without all the Lo without all the contraction and job yeah so so I guess how do you really address it when so much of the economy and so many people's jobs and livelihoods are dependent on government spending well I mean I I do think it's it's it's sort of um you know it's it's false dichotomy it's not like no government spending is going to happen um you really have to say like is it the right level um and just remember that that you know any any given person if they are doing things in a less efficient organization versus a more efficient organization their contribution to the economy their net output of goods and services will reduce um I mean you've got a couple of clear examples between East Germany and West Germany North Korea and South Korea um I mean North Korea they're starving uh South Korea it's like amazing it's the future the compounding effect of productivity gains yeah yeah it's night and day yeah um and so in the north North Korea you've got 100% government um and in South Korea you've got probably I don't know 40% government it's not zero um and yet you've got a standard of living that is probably 10 times higher in South Korea at least at least exactly um uh and then East and West Germany um in West Germany uh you you had just thinking in terms of cars I mean you had BMW Porsche Audi Mercedes um and and East Germany which is a random line on a map um you you the the car only car you could get was a a trabant which is basically a lawn mower with a shell on it um and uh it was extremely unsafe you there was a 20-year weit so you like you know put your kid on the list as soon as they're conceived um and and even then only I think um you know a quarter of people maybe got got this lousy car and the same so so that's just an interesting example of like basically the same people different operating system and and it's not like uh West Germany was some you know you know a capitalist uh Heaven it was it's quite socialist actually so uh so when you look you know probably it was half half government in West Germany and and 100% governor in East Germany and again sort of a five to i' like call it call at least a 5 to 10x standard of living difference that and even qualitatively vastly better and and it's obviously you know person people have these amazingly in this modern era this debate as to which system is better well I'll tell you which system is better um the one that doesn't need to build the worldall to keep people in okay that's that's how you can tell okay it's a dead giveaway spoiler alert dead giveaway are they climbing the wall to get out or come in you have to build a barrier to keep people in that is the bad system um it wasn't West West berin that built the wall okay they were like to you know anyone who wants to flee Westland go ahead um speaking of walls so it you know and and and and if you look at sort of the flux of boats from Cuba there's a large number of boats from Cuba and there's a bunch of free boats that you anyone can take Toba plent of seats there's like hey wow an abandoned boat I could use this boat to go to Cuba where they have communism awesome Yes um and and and yet nobody nobody picks up those boats and and does it amazing um so you given this a lot of thought yeah wait so your point is jobs will be created if we cut government spending in half jobs will be created fast enough to make up for right just the C yes obviously you know I'm not suggesting that that people you know um have like are immediately turfed you know tossed out with with no severance and and you know can't now can't pay their mortgage they need to be some reasonable offramp uh where yeah yeah um so reasonable offramp where you know they're still um you know earning they're still receiving money but have like I don't know a year or two to to f to find jobs in the private sector which they will find and then they will be in a different operating system um again you can see the difference East Germany was incorporated into West Germany living standards in East Germany Rose dramatically um well so in four years if you could shrink the side the size of the government with Trump what would be a good Target just in terms of like ballpark I mean are you trying to get me assassinated before this even happens no no Piccolo number I mean you know there's that old phrase go postal I mean it's like they might yeah on me so we'll keep the post office I mean I'm going to need a h a security detail guys yes I mean the year number of disgruntled workers for former government employees is you know quite a scary number I mean I might not make it you know I was saying low low digits every year for four years would be palatable yeah and I like your idea of the thing is that if if it's not done uh like if you have a once once in a lifetime or once in a generation opportunity and you don't take Serious action and and then you have four years to get it done and then and if it doesn't get done then how serious is Trump about this like you've talked to him about it yeah yeah I think he is very serious about it got it um and no I I think actually the reality is that if we get rid of nonsense regulations and shift people from the government sector to the private sector we will have immense Prosperity um and and I think we'll have a golden age in this country and it'll be fantastic can we uh can we talk about SP um you have a bunch of critical Milestones coming up um yeah in fact uh there's an important a very exciting launch um that uh is may be happening tonight so if if that if the weather is is holding up then I'm going to leave here head to Cape canaval uh for the um the the pl stor Mission which is a private Mission so founded by Dereck um Jed isman and he's um awesome guy and and there this will be the first time uh the first private first first commercial space walk um and and'll be at at the highest altitude uh since Apollo so it's the furthest from Earth that anyone's gone and you know what comes after that let's assume that's successful and I sure hope so man um no pressure um yeah you know Absolut you know astronaut prior astronaut safety is man if I had like all all the all the wishes I could save up that'll be the one to to put on so you know space is dangerous um so the the yeah the next Milestone after that would be the next flight of Starship um which um you know Starship is the next flight of Starship is ready to fly we are waiting for regulatory approval you know yeah it it it it really should not be possible to build a giant rocket faster than the paper can move from one desk to another St is really hard approved yeah you ever see that movie through toia you ever see that movie zootopia there's like a sloth in for the approval it will accidentally tell a joke and and I was like oh no this is going to take a long time sorry sorry um but yeah zootopia you know you know the funny thing is like so I went to the DMV about I don't know a year later after zootopia and to get my what of license renewal and the guy in in an exercise of incredible self-awareness had the sloth from zootopia in his um in his cube in in in his Cube and he was actually Swift yeah with the with the Mandate beat the sloth yeah yeah no personal agency personal agency no I mean some as people like think the you know the government is um more competent than it than it is I'm not saying that there aren't competent people in the government they're just in an operating system that is inefficient um once you move them to a more efficient operating system they their output is dramatically greater as we've seen examp you know when East Germany was reintegrated to into with West Germany and and and the same people um were vastly more prosperous uh with a basically half capitalist uh operating system so um but I mean for a lot of people they like the maybe most direct experience with the government is the DMV um and and then the important thing to remember is the the government is the DMV at scale right that's the government got the mental picture how much do you want to scale it yeah yeah sorry can you go back to chim's um uh question on Star so you you announced just the other day Starship going to Mars in two years and by the way huh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then four years for crude uh aspirational launch in the next window and how much is the government involved not saying like say you watch by these not you know uh but these uh but it based on our current progress where with Starship We were able to successfully reach oval of velocity twice uh we were able to achieve soft Landings of the the booster and the ship in in water uh and that's despite the ship having you know half its flaps cooked off um you can see the video on the xplatform it's quite exciting um so you know we we we think we'll be able to have to launch reliably and repeatedly and quite quickly um and the the the fundamental Holy Grail breakthrough for rocketry for to what the fundamental breakthrough that is needed for life to become multiplanetary is a rapidly reusable reliable rocket r with a pirate somehow um throw a pirate in there um the so with Starship is the first rocket design where success is one of the possible outcomes with full reusability um so you for any given project you have to say this is the circle so write band diagrams um here's a circle and is Success the success dot in the circle um is is success in the set of possible outcomes that's uh you know sounds pretty obvious but there're often projects where that that is success is not in the set of possible outcomes um and so so Starship not only is fully full reusability in the set of possible outcomes it it is being proven with each launch um and and and U I'm confident it will succeed it's simply a matter of time and you know if if we can get some improvement in the speed of Regulation we we could actually move a lot faster um uh so that would that would be very helpful and and in fact if if this if if something isn't done about um reducing regulation and and sort of speeding up approvals and to be clear I'm not talking about anything unsafe it's simply the processing of the safe thing can be done at a as as fast as the rocket is built not slow up then uh then then we could become a space staring civilization and a multiplet species ultimate and be out there among the stars in the future and there's you know it's it's just very like it's incredibly important that we have things that that we find inspiring that you look to the Future and say the future is going to be better than the past things to look forward to and like like kids are a good a good way to assess this like what are kids fired up about and if you can say you know you you could you know you could be an Astron on Mars you you could maybe one day uh go beyond the solar system um we could make Star Trek starf Academy real um that is an exciting future that is inspiring um you know just I mean you need things that move your heart right um [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah let's do it I mean like like life can't just be about solving one miserable problem after another there's got to be things that you for to as well yeah uh and and do do you think you might have to move it to a different jurisdiction to move faster I've always wondered if like it's rocket technology is considered an advanced weapons technology so we can't just go do it you know in another country yes in it you yeah interesting and if we don't do it other countries could do it I mean they're so far behind us but theoretically there's a national security you know justification here if if somebody can put their thinking caps on like do we want to have this technology that you're building the team's working so hard on stolen by other countries and then you know maybe they don't have as much red tape I I wish people were trying to steal it um so that no no one's trying to steal it it's just too this is It's too crazy basically um and that's for you yeah it's way too crazy what do you think um is going on that led to Boeing building the star the way that they did they were able to get it up but not complete but can't complete they can't finish can't finish and now you're going to have to go up and finish um um well I mean I think Boeing is a company that is you they actually do so much business with the government they have sort of impedance match to the government so they're they're like basically one notch away from the government maybe they're not far from the government from an efficiency standpoint because they derive so much of the revenue from the government um a lot of people think well SpaceX is super depend on the government and actually no most of our revenue is commercial um so um and and and and there's been I think at least up until perhaps recently because they have a new CEO who actually shows up in the factory yeah um and the the the CEO before that I think had a degree in accounting and and never went to the factory and didn't know how airplanes flew um so I think if you are in charge of a company that makes airplanes fly and uh spacecraft go to Orit you need to know it can't be a total mystery as to how they work yeah so you know I'm like sure if somebody's like running coko Pepsi and and they're like great at marketing or whatever um that's that's fine because you know it's it's not a sort of Technology dependent business um you know or if they're running a you know financial consulting and their degrees in accounting that makes sense um but I think uh you know if you're if you're the Cavalry Captain you should know how to ride a horse pretty basic yeah yeah it's like it's disconcerning if the Cavalry Captain just Falls a horse you know heuck the team I'm sorry I'm scared of horses gets on backwards I'm like oops um sh shifting gears to AI uh Peter was here earlier and he was talking about how so far the only company to really make money off AI is NVIDIA with the chips um do you have a sense yet of where you think the big applications will be from AI is it going to be an enabling self-driving is it going to be enabling robots is it transforming Industries I mean it's still I think early in terms of where the big business impact is going to be do you have a sense yet I I mean I think I think they they're the spending on AI probably runs ahead of I mean does run ahead of the revenue right now that's there's no question about that um but the rate of improvement of AI is faster than any technology I've ever seen by far and and and it it's I mean like the for example the touring test used to be a thing now you know your basic uh open source random llm you're writing on a freaking Raspberry Pi probably could uh you know beat the touring test um so there's I I I I think actually like like the the good future of AI is one of immense Prosperity where there is an age of abundance no shortage of goods and services everyone can have whatever they want unless except for things we artificially Define to be scarce like some special artwork um but but anything that is a manufactured go or provided Service uh will I think with the adment of AI plus robotics that the cost of goods and services will be will Trend to zero like I'm not saying it be actually zero but it'll be every everyone will be able to have anything they want uh that that's the good future of course and you know in my view that's probably 80% likely so look on the bright side only 20% 20% probability of annihilation it's nothing um is is the 20% like what does that look like I don't man I mean frankly I do have to go engage in some degree of of deliberate suspension of disbelief with respect to AI in order to sleep well um and even then um because I I I I think the actual issue the the most likely issue is like well how do we find meaning in a world where AI can do everything we can do a bit better that that is that is perhaps the bigger challenge um although you know at this point I know more and more people who are retired and they seem to enjoy that life so uh but I think that that may be maybe there'll be some crisis of meaning like because the computer can do everything you can do bit better so maybe that'll be a challenge um but but really uh you know you need you need the sort of end factors you need the the autonomous cars and you need the sort of humanoid robots or your general purpose robots uh but the once you have general purpose humanoid robots um and autonomous vehicles uh you really you you you can build anything um and and and this I think that there's no actual limit to the size of the economy I mean there obviously you know the mass of Earth you know like that be limit um but the you know the the economy is is really just the average productivity per person times number of people that's the economy and if you if you've got humanoid robots that can do you know where there's no real limit on the number of humanoid robots um and and they they can operate very intelligently then then there's no actual limit to the economy and there's no meaningful limit to the economy you guys just turned on Colossus which is like the largest private compute cluster I guess of gpus anywhere is that right it's it's the it's the most powerful supercomputer of any kind um which sort of speaks to what David said and kind of what Peter said which is a lot of the kind of economic value so far of ai ai has entirely gone to Nvidia but there are people with Alternatives and you're actually one with an alternative now you have a very specific case because Dojo is really about images and large images huge video um yeah I mean the Tesla problem is different from the um you know the sort of llm problem uh the nature of the intelligence actually is actually and and the what matters in the AI is is different um to to the point you just made which is that in the in T's case the context uh length is very long so we've got gigabytes of context context Windows yeah yeah you got you know sort of um I was just bringing it up kind of billions of tokens of context nighty amount of context because you've got um seven seven cameras and if if you've got several you know let's say you've got a minute of several high high def cameras then that's gigabytes so you're need to compress so the Tesla problem is you got to compress a gigantic context um into the the pixels that are that actually matter um and you know and and and condense that over a time so you've got to in both uh the time Dimension the space Dimension you've got to compress the pixels u in space and the pixels over it in time um and and and then and then have that inference done on a tiny computer relatively speaking a small like you know a few hundred watt uh it's a Tesla designed AI inference computer uh which is by still the best there isn't a better thing we could buy from suppliers so the Tesla designed uh AI infer computer that's in the cars is better than anything we could buy from any supplier just by the way that's kind of a by the way the the Tesla a a team is extremely good well you guys in the design there was a technical paper and there was a deck that somebody on your team from Tesla published and it was stunning to me you designed your own transport control like layer over ethernet you were like ah ethernet's not good enough for us you had this TT Coe or something and you're like oh we're just going to reinvent ethernet and like string these chips it's pretty incredible stuff that's happening over there yeah um no the team the the Tesla chip design team is extremely extremely good um so um but is there a world where for example other people over time that need you know some sort of like video use case or image case theoretically you know You' say oh why not you know I have some extra Cycles over here so which should kind of make you a competitor of Nvidia it's not intentionally per se but um yeah I mean the you know this training and inference and we we do have the you know two those two projects at Tes we've got Dojo which is the the training computer uh and then um you know our inference chip which is in every every car inference computer um so and Dojo we've only had Dojo one Dojo 2 is um you know should be we should have Dojo 2 in volume towards the end of next year um and and that that that will be we think sort of comparable to uh the sort of a b200 Ty type system a training system um and um you know so there's I guess there's some potential for for that to be used as a service um and like you Dojo is is just kind of like I mean we're we're I guess I guess I have like some improved confidence in dojo um but I think we won't really know how good Dojo is until probably version three like usually takes three major iterations on a technology for it to be to be excellent um and we'll only have the second major iteration next year um the third iteration I don't know maybe late you know 26 or something like that how's the uh how's the Optimus project going I remember when we talked last um and you said this publicly that it's in doing some light testing inside the factory um so it's actually being useful what's the build of materials and when you know for something like that at scale so when you start making it like you're making the model 3 now and there's a million of them coming off the factory line what would the they cost 203 $40,000 you think yeah I mean what I mean I've discovered really that you know anything made in sufficient volume will ASM totically approach the cost of its of its uh materials so now there's there's I should say the there's some some things are constrained by cost of intellectual property and like paying for patents and stuff so a lot of you know what what's in a a chip is like paying paying royalties um and depreciation of the chip faab so but the actual marginal cost of the chips is very low um so so so Optimus it obviously is humanoid robot it it is it weighs much less and it's much smaller than a car so the you could expect that in high volume and I'd say you also probably need three three production versions of Optimus so you need to refine the design three at least three major times and and then you need scale production to sort of the million unit plus per year level and I think at that point the cost the the you know the labor material on Optimus is probably not much more than $110,000 yeah and that's a decade long journey maybe basically think of it like Optimus will cost less than um a a small car right so at at scale volume with three major iterations of technology and and so if a small car you know cost $25,000 you know it's it's it's probably like I don't know $220,000 for for an Optimus for a humanoid robot that can be your your buddy like a combination of R2D2 and c3p but better I mean you know that's that's honest I think people are going to get really attached to their humanoid robot because I mean like you look at sort of you watch Star Wars it's like R2D2 and C3 I love those guys um you know they're awesome um and their have personality and and I mean and all all R2 could do is just beef at you couldn't couldn't speak English um C3 you to translate the beeps you know so you're in year two of that if you did two or three years per iteration or something it's a decade long journey for this to hit some sort of scale um I I would say ma major iterations are less than two years so okay um it's probably on the order of five five years yeah uh maybe six to get to a million units a year and at that price point everybody can afford one on planet Earth I mean it's going to be that one: one two to one what do you think ultimately if we're sitting here in 30 years the number of robots on the planet versus Humans yeah I think the number of robots will vastly exceed the number of humans vastly yeah vastly exceed I mean you have to say like who who would not want their robot buddy everyone wants to Rob bu um you know this is like it especially if can you know you know it can take care of your your take your dog for a walk it could you know mo most the lawn it could watch your kids uh it could you know like it could it could teach your kids it could it could we could also send it to Mars AB we send a lot of robots to Mars to do the work needed to yeah make it a colonized planet for Mars is already the robot Planet there's like a whole bunch of you know robots like Rovers and helicopter yes only robots um so yeah the no I I think the the sort of useful humanoid robot opportunity is the single biggest opportunity ever um because if you assume like that I mean the I think the ratio of humanoid robots to humans is going to be at least 2 to one maybe 3 to one because everybody every everybody will want one and then there will be a bunch of robots that you don't see that are making goods and services and you think it's a general one generalized robot that then learns how to do different tasks or yeah hey um I mean we we are a generalized yeah we're generaliz we're just made of meat EXA uh we're a meat but we generalized meat yeah I mean operating my meat puppet you know um so um yeah we are actually and by it turns out like as we're designing Optimus we sort of learn more and more about why humans are shaped the way they're shaped and you know and why we have five fingers and why your little finger is smaller than you know your index finger um you know you know obviously why you have POS posable thumbs but also why for example your the muscles the major muscles that operate your hand are actually in your forearm and and your fingers are primarily operated like um your the muscles that actuate your fingers um are located the vast majority of the of the of your finger strength is actually coming from your forearm um and your fingers are being operated by tendons little strings that that that's and so the current version of the Optimus hand uh has the actuators in the hand and has only 11 degrees of freedom so it can't it's not as doesn't have all the degrees of freedom of human hand which has depending on how you counted a roughly 25 degrees of freedom um and uh and and and and it's also like lot strong enough in certain ways because the actuators have to fit in the hand um so the next generation Optimus hand uh which we have in Prototype form uh the the actuators have moved to the forearm just like human and they operate the the fingers through cables just like a human hand and uh and then the next Generation hand has 22 degrees of freedom um which we think is enough to do almost anything that a human can do um and presumably I think it was written that X and Tesla may work together and you know provide services but my immediate thought went to oh if you just provide a grock to the robot then the robot has a personality and can process oh yeah voice and video and images and all of that stuff as the uh as wrap here I think uh you know everybody talks about all the projects you're working on but um people don't know you have a great sense of humor that's not true oh you do you do um people don't see it but I would say one of I know for me the funniest week of my life or one of the funniest was when you did SNL and we got and you I got to tag along maybe you saw it um maybe behind the scenes like some of your funniest Recollections of that chaotic insane week when we laughed for 12 hours a day it was a little terrorizing on the first couple of days but yeah I was I was bit worried the beginning there because frankly nothing was funny um day one was rough rough um yeah so I mean it's like a rule but can't you guys just say it just say the stuff that got on the cutting some the funniest skits were the ones they didn't let you do that's what I'm saying can you just say there were a couple of funny ones yeah that they didn't let you you can say it so that he doesn't get I mean how much time do we have here well we should just give one or two CU it was in your mind which one do we regret most not getting on air you really want to hear that I I mean I mean it was a little spicy it was a little funny okay here we go all right here we go guys all right so one of the things that um I think everyone's been sort of wondering this whole time is is Saturday night Saturday Night Live actually live like live live live live or do they have like a delay or like just in case you know there's a wardrobe malfunction or something like that uh is it like a you know truly 5sec delay what's really going on but there's a there's a way to test this right we came along the way there's a way to test this um which is we don't tell them what's going on as I I W on says this is the script I'll throw it on the ground we're gonna find out tonight right now if Saturday live if Saturday Night Live is actually life and the way that we're going to do this is I'm going to take my [ __ ] [Laughter] [Applause] out this is the greatest pitch ever and and if if if if you see my carck you know it's true and if you don't it's been a lie it's been a lie all these years all these years now this is we're going to bust them right now and this we're pitching this yeah yeah so we're pitching this on Zoom yeah we're pitching this on zoom on like a Monday after like we're like kind of hung over from the weekend and like pitching this like and and and it's h it's you know Jason's on um and uh Mike and you yeah and Mike uh you know essentially got like you know who my friends I think of sort of you know quite funny um you know uh Jason's quite funny I think like like Jason's the closest thing to Cartman that us in the real in real life we have a show that he's buts and I'm Cartman yeah so um and then my friend Mike's Prett funny too so so we we come in like like just like guns blazing guns blazing with with like ideas and and we didn't realize like actually you know that's not how it works and and and uh that that it's normally like actors and and they just get told what to do I'm like oh right well you mean we can't just like do funny things that we thought of what they're they're watching this and on the zoom they're a gas pitch yeah silence like so I'm like and I'm like and I was like is this thing working is this Che are we muted is is our mic on and they're like we hear you yeah and then and then after a long silence like Mike's Mike just says the word crickets crickets and they're not laughing going to not even a chugle what's going on and then Elon explains the punch line which is exactly so so there's more to it okay yes that's just the beginning so Elon says so so then I'm so I'm like so so so so I said like I'm I'm I'm G to I'm going to reach [Laughter] down into my pants and into my pants and and I stick my hand in my pants and I'm going to and I'm and I'm going to pull my car and I tell this to the audience and the audience is going to be like go right and and and and then and and then and then and then I pull out a a a baby rooster you know yes and it's like okay this is kind of PG you know it's like that not that bad it's like this is my tiny [ __ ] and and and it's like what do you think uh so then and do you think it's an ice coock I mean I like it I pitch I like and then Kate McKennon walks out yeah exactly and I'm like oh no but you haven't heard half of it until Kate McKennon comes out and she says Elon I expected you would have a bigger [ __ ] yeah I like I I don't mean to disappoint you Kate but yeah um but I I I hope you like it anyway um and then but Kate's got to come out with with with her cat okay right uh so and Kate said you see where you can see where this is going and I say nice wow that's that's a that's a that's a nice [ __ ] you've got there Kate wow that's amazing um it looks a little wet was it raining outside and then um do do you mind if I stroke your [ __ ] is that cool it's like oh no Elon actually can I hold your [ __ ] of course of course Kate you definitely hold my [ __ ] um and and then you know we exchange and I think just the audio version of this is pretty good right um and and and um you know she was like wow you I I really like um stroking your [ __ ] and I was like I and then El says well I'm really enjoying strug at your [ __ ] yes of course and um yeah so you know they're looking at us like oh my god what have we done inviting these lunatics on the program yeah then they said they said like well um it is uh it is Mother's Day it's Mother's Day we might not want to go with this one mom's in the audience and I'm like well that's a good point well fair fair it might be a bit uncomfortable for all the moms in the audience maybe I don't know I don't know maybe they'll dig it maybe they like it uh so uh yeah that was that's the um that's the that's the that's the um cold open that didn't make it we didn't get that on the air um but uh we did did fight for Doge yes and we got Doge on the I mean there's a bunch of things that I said that were just not on the script like they have these like Q cards for what you're supposed to say and I just didn't say it I just went off off the rails yeah they didn't see that coming yeah it's live well it's live and uh so the Elon wanted to do Doge this is the other one he wanted to do Doge on late night and he says um Hey Jake Al can you um make sure oh yeah so I want yeah I wanted to do the Doge father that like you sort of redo the you know that scene from uh the The Godfather I mean you kind of need the music to cue things up you bring me on my daughter's wedding L and you ask for do yeah you got R I give you Bitcoin but you want do exactly it's you really got to set the mood you have to have the tuxedo do and you got to have like like Mar br said you come to me on this day of my Do's wedding and you ask me for your private keys are you even a friend you call me the Doge father so you know so that has potential they had great potential so they come to me and I'm I'm talking to Colin um and Joe who's got a great sense of humor and he's amazing he loves Elon and he's like we can't do it because of the law and stuff like that the law and liability so I said it's okay Elon called Comcast and he put in an offer and they just accepted it he just bought NBC so it's fine yeah and Colin Joe looks at me and I sold this so good and he's like you're you're serious I'm like yep we own NBC now yeah and he's like okay well that kind of changes things doesn't it I'm like absolutely where a go on on Doge yeah and then he's like you're [ __ ] with me and I'm I'm [ __ ] with you or are we or are we it was the greatest week of and that like is like two of 10 stories yeah we got yeah we got we'll save the other eight yeah but it was and I was just so happy for you to see you have a great week of just joy and fun and letting go cuz you were launching Rockets you're deal de with so much [ __ ] in your life to have those moments to share them and just laugh um it was just so great and more of those moments I think we got to we got to get you back on SNL who wants to back on SNL one more time all right ladies and gentlemen our bestie Elon Musk thank you hello hello all right guys thank you for an amazing day we're gonna start the Top Gun party at the Santa Monica Pier at 700 p.m. there are shuttles leaving starting at 615 from the W Hotel the kton the Beverly Hills Hotel the lusin the Courtyard Marriott and the P house Westwood you don't need to be staying there to grab a shuttle feel free to head over there shuttles are going to be leaving from the pier back to those locations starting at 9:00 we're starting at 9:30 tomorrow not 10 um there's not going to be secret service so it'll be faster see you all tomorrow thank you right about now the funk so brother check it out I'm going
