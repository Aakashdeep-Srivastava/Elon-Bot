[Music] D musk is in control of Twitter this morning he'll have no shareholders to answer to says he wants to transform the company Elon Musk has one rule that guides him which is never be constrained by the rules correspondent James jacobe investigates Elon musk's expanding influence I am trying to do good for Humanity and the future of civilization with company insiders well was it like for you for the first time in a long time I was terrified and Industry experts I thought he'd be a good owner why cuz he has the money the means and the creativity oh he is changing the social media platform we must protect Free Speech I've never seen a billionaire own a media platform that so obviously is using it as a personal platform and the implications for free speech since mus took over what would you say your main findings have been number one I would say harassment has increased the massive rebranding of Twitter Miss bading post about the ongoing Israeli Palestinian conflict this guy amazing success story who decided to go by Twitter cuz he cares so much about the First Amendment foreign disinformation do you agree that's a threat yeah no one appreciates that but the first amendment is the first amendment now on front line Elon Musk the world's richest man because I've done himself Elon Musk Elon Musk musk musk musk Elon Musk Elon Musk Elon musk's Twitter takeover he wants to shake things up and when things are calm he seeks out storms launch Auto sequence initiated AKA The Holy Mouse click for 345 liftoff # Falcon heavy launch countdown one SpaceX heavy go for launch 10 9 eight Side based oration six it had all the elements of a perfect day for Elon Musk to heavy a test launch of his latest reusable rocket the most powerful in the world capable of deep space [Applause] exploration it was a crucial step toward his ultimate goal the conquest of Mars Elon Musk I think gets his most pleasure out of rocket ships and at moments when the Rockets go off that's when the childish pleasure comes out t plus 302 if you can hear me over the cheering Falcon heavy heading to space on our test flight he doesn't usually like having pleasure he doesn't Savor the moment but he does when it's a rocket launch camera views from inside the payload fairing # Falcon heavy throughout the day must provided running commentary at his favorite place to express himself the social media site Twitter upper stage restart nominal ape raised to 7,000 km he's a performer he likes it he likes it he likes playing Elon I I swear he thinks he's Iron Man right on Q musk's rocket discharged his own cherry red Tesla complete with the mannequin in the driver's seat Elon Musk has outdone himself this time normally for a new rocket you know they launch like a block of concrete I mean that's so boring it's still tripping me out I mean I'm tripping Bulls here the electric car and the reusable rocket were part of a vast business Empire from neurotechnology to artificial intelligence to a web of satellites encircling the Earth that has made Elon Musk one of the richest and most powerful men in the world view from SpaceX launch control apparently there is a car in orbit around Earth and the app he was using to live tweet the launch a few years later that would be his too Elon Musk puts in an offer to buy Twitter Elon Musk and Twitter announced a $44 billion deal today from he says he wants to transform the company well I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech for the past 6 months we've been investigating Elon musk's controversial purchase of Twitter how it's expanded his influence into politics at a time of deep division Across America now we've got someone who's going to take over Twitter who actually believes in the Constitution and free speech and what it means for one of the world's most important platforms for news and political debate to be under the control of one man this is a human being that we're giving all of this power to and there are very few checks on that power right now this is the story of Elon musk's latest Mission and its far-reaching consequences a new name for Twitter Twitter owner Elon Musk has replaced the iconic bird logo with an X this came with almost no warning as he made the announcement that the platform will now be known as x.com today construction Crews blocked a lane on Market Street to take down the Twitter sign letter by letter passers by stopped clicked and shared on social media what was happening I don't know what the thought process is this is probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen I think it's thing over the span of just a few days in July 2023 Twitter disappeared and became X named after Elon musk's favorite letter you know what Elon Musk thinks he's Batman and I'm over it the former Twitter building now home to X and the giant X sign and the neighbors say the lights coming from that X sign are simply blinding it was the end of a brand that had grown grown into a global icon since its founding 17 years ago there is a new service and supposedly it is the next big thing it's a name you can't forget it's called Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter what is Twitter it's stupid and lame and small yet master blogger Robert scobble can't keep his fingertips off Twitter is rather addictive we're looking at my Twitter account and Twitter was founded in 2006 as a simple messaging platform where users posted about daily life users no longer need a PC or a Blog messaging can be typed by cell phone that's its selling point but it quickly evolved into what became known as the global Town Square what made you want to get up and do something Twitter it felt like it was where the conversation was happening if there was a news story that dropped on the New York Times it was debated on Twitter if a journalist like me felt like their story was going viral it was going viral on Twitter you sent me a tweet the queen started tweeting the Pop's first tweet it had famous people across Sports media politics John obviously needs to work on his typing skills and just like generally funny people who were good at Twitter and the kind of combination of all of those things felt like it was where the conversation was happening I just typed something in to my iPhone and boom it's in their brains musk joined the conversation in 2010 please ignore prior tweets as that was someone pretending to be me this is actually me at the time the South African born entrepreneur was already rich and had a reputation for taking risks he'd used the fortune he made as a founder of PayPal to start a rocket company and to buy a stake in Tesla a fledgeling electric car company that under his leadership would revolutionize the industry and earn musk praise as a Pioneer in the fight against climate change on Twitter he started sharing books he liked and random observations about the world compared to past today's world is fantastic I like donon I like I thought he was quirky and interesting and creative you could warm Mars up over time with greenhouse gases and kind of the opposite of what we're doing on Earth yeah this is great I was in great admiration because most people in Silicon Valley are talking about stupid things or making dating apps he was doing significant stuff thanks for having me it's great to see you guys thank you for coming I really appreciate it you kept your promise which was nice Cara swisser writes about Silicon Valley and has known musk for more than 20 years talk she's interviewed him multiple times you started covering musk I mean even before PayPal right yes there was a million startup people like him in Silicon Valley but I remember him and what what were your impressions of him then I paid pretty good attention to him but not a lot particularly but then when he started doing the stuff around SpaceX and bought Tesla from the actual Founders that was interesting because he was different the real big breakthrough that's needed with r street is a truly reusable run how do you split your time between car and Rocket well it's usually about 50/50 he was a smart person doing big things and so there weren't there literally can't think of someone who was doing as big things as he was what's going on with you and Twitter some people some people use their hair to express themselves I use Twitter but there was another side to musk that swisser came to know over the years he's such a quirky personality and an unusual sense of humor that um much more juvenile than the other boys they're all boys but you know it was even more so a lot of fart jokes or uh penis jokes and you know whatever I you know he liked those he thought they were hysterical I'm reading Robert massie's book on Catherine the Great yeah I know what you're probably thinking did she really a horse for musk Twitter was the perfect Outlet twit has always been a place where you can be very honest there were a lot of sassy comments a lot of wit and yeah a lot of things that riled people up that was literally what Twitter was for Twitter was the Free Speech wing of the Free Speech party and didn't have any rules that was very much the approach when these companies were starting I love [Music] Twitter Elon Musk is more impetuous more impulsive more addicted to things than anybody I've ever seen that's what drives him when he gets riled up he either tweets or plays video games musk wouldn't talk to Frontline but biographer Walter Isaacson spent the past two years shadowing him you as a kid he was bullied on the playground and he was a scraw kid so he kept getting beaten up they push him down the concrete steps and bloody his face some of the bullies and those scars have always been with him whenever he gets into a dark place he remembers that playground and he goes dark and in some ways Twitter is the ultimate Global playground except for the scrawny kids and the smart kids get followers they don't get smashed into the concrete steps you use your tweeting to to kind of get back at critics you kind of have little Wars with the Press Twitter is a war zone if somebody's going to jump in the war zone it's like okay you're in the arena let's go musk's natural affinity for Twitter earned him millions of followers then tens of millions Elon Musk was insanely popular on Twitter he'd always had a ton of followers but he was inching up to being the most followed person on Twitter and it felt like everything he touched turned to gold in terms of follower count so if he interacted with someone suddenly that person's follower count shot up it just felt like there was so much engagement and interest in everything he did Elon had evangelists he attracted a kind of very online mostly male following that wants technology to save the world it was very clear to me that his followers had this kind of Brotherly sense or my cool older brother my cool Uncle my cool dad who is trying to fix the world for me Tesla shares surging following CEO Elon Musk cryptic tweets saying it's added a lot of value to his you know wealth and to the value of his companies well sharers of paloalto based Tesla jumped more than 2% following this mysterious teasing message from CEO Alon musk he wrote It's like enabled Tesla to raise money it's increased the size of his fortune and uh that's from Twitter yeah this is Mark yeah Tesla says we don't really spend on advertising and marketing because Elon Musk is on Twitter it was a similar approach to another businessman who' mastered the art of Twitter I have a big voice I have you know millions and millions of followers on Twitter and when I say something people some people don't like it but most people do like it Donald Trump used Twitter for years to pump himself his businesses his show and it was how he got this massive following what a and Elon used Twitter the same exact way there's very little difference similar Playbook similar Playbook you know if I tweet something CNN and fox all of a sudden they say we have breaking news Donald Trump has just made it I'm sitting there tweeting big big Donald Trump's use of Twitter to circumvent the media first as a candidate then as president elevated Twitter to the most influential political platform in America president Trump tweeted to announce his firing of his Secretary of Veterans Affairs president Trump tweeting out policy on gun safety in our nation's schools president Trump tweeting moments ago Rex Tillerson out as Secretary of State Twitter skyrocketed to a level of prominence that I don't think its Founders really expected is there an effort within the White House to try to rein in the president's Twitter habit it also took on this Central role in Democratic deliberation that I don't think anybody could have expected a single Tech platform to do but for most of this time musk had steered clear of political controversy on Twitter to be clear I'm not a conservative am registered independent and politically moderate I never knew elon's politics like they were all over the place he voted for Obama he was a big Obama supporter I remember he liked Obama better than I did you never knew where he was going to come down politically you didn't like I didn't ever feel he had any big Point of View California is now under a Statewide stay-at-home order the first the pandemic would spark a shift in musk that like so much in his life would play out on Twitter the Corona virus Panic is dumb I think Elon musk's tweets are a lot more fun when stocks go up and it's a bull market when it's more serious like this it feels a little like you know not the time not now Elon he had a point of view about that the the virus was not dangerous and that might have been but at the time people did not know and it could have gone a lot of different ways and a million people died at one point he was like I read everything and I now know and I'm like thank you Dr musk and I was like you don't know anything it's like ridiculous well they're wrong about the mask wearing or they're wrong about the don't touch thing I said well they didn't know now they know it's called science California's 40 million residents are in lockdown at the time the government had ordered musk to close his Tesla factories in California I mean he was pissed that his factories were were kind of forced to close ultimately yes that's the thing he wanted them there and he wanted them working he thought it was the it was an existential crisis if Tesla didn't succeed he really that for the world for all of us and then it got weird free America now people their freedom hit in California have been half empty this whole time now people back their freedom musk told his employees that he intended to defy orders and go to work Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla is defying stay-at-home orders daring authorities to arrest him by reopening his California Factory CEO Elon Musk tweeted I will be on the line with everyone else if anyone is arrested I ask that it only be me musk AED his frustrations on a Tesla earnings call frankly I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights what the excuse me this is fascist this is not Democratic this is not Freedom give people put back their damn Freedom musk's rhetoric on Co would win him an unexpected Ally and president Trump who tweeted California should let Tesla and Elon Musk open the plant now musk tweeted back thank you when you say civilization's fragile do you mean because of this coid 19 that's going on right now what's that I never heard of it this this thing he also found a sympathetic ear with Joe Rogan the most popular podcaster in the country gener I think that's like we we should be concerned about um anything that's a massive infringement on our civil Li civil liberties yes yeah my my opinion is if if if somebody wants to stay home they should stay home and if say somebody doesn't want to stay home they should not be compelled to stay home in May a cryptic tweet from musk signaled his shifting politics when he tweets take the red pill a line from The Matrix it means question this ideology that may have been imposed try to find out out the real truth all I'm offering is the truth nothing more but it was mostly a signal that he had joined that I'd call it the somewhat conspiratorial uh people on the right who feel that the media and the establishment are imposing a narrative on us today as protests erupted across the country many Governors say it's still too soon to lift restrictions musk's position on the pandemic aligned him with the growing chorus of conservatives who felt their personal Liberty was under attack from all sides this our First Amendment right the government the scientific establishment the press and increasingly social media he was also noticing that on Twitter if you said that lockdowns could cause more harm than good you'd be kind of repressed on Twitter so this made them upset they're saying to us if you dare go against what we say is true not necessarily what is true but what we say is true then we're going to boot you it's true that social media companies had become more proactive about what was on their sites I'd call this here into order and I'd like to welcome our Witnesses today Jack dorsy chief executive officer at Twitter for years before the pandemic Twitter's CEO and founder Jack dorsy had been criticized in the press and lamb based in Congress for his company's failure to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation especially after Russian interference in the 2016 election we're now removing over 200% more accounts for violating our policies we were tasked with making sure our algorithms were responding in a way that was actually beneficial to humanity not driving misinformation not driving bias and discrimination Raman chowy a data scientist ran a team of Engineers at Twitter tasked with ensuring the platform's algorithms did not promote harmful content there are millions of tweets any given second that you could see on your timeline your little iPhone screen only shows maybe three of those at a time so we have to build multiple systems that are identifying what you'd want to see it I mean it shapes the universe of what people are seeing absolutely it shapes the universe of perception it is telling us what is important and what is not important so my team's job was to ensure that the algorithms that we're building were responding to some of the issues that governments were talking about people were talking about and this increasing fear of how social media might be changing the course of Elections how it might be you know um making children's Minds rot how it might be polarizing young men and causing some of the violence that we're seeing in the world how it might be spreading lies more than truth absolutely that's definitely a concern in late 2019 Twitter fielded a large scale study of users of the service and asked them do you think Twitter should take some type of action on misinformation and what we heard back from a majority of users globally was yes yel raw started at Twitter in 2015 while finishing his PhD in Communications he would work his way up to run in the content moderation team a job that would ultimately lead him to clash with Elon Musk Twitter's users told us that when it came to certain types of harmful misinformation they didn't think it was acceptable for the company to do nothing they wanted us to step in and so that's what we did that seems like a particularly messy business for a social media a company like Twitter how did you think about your role as sort of an Arbiter of Truth misinformation was one of the hardest policy issues for Twitter to take on for many years our position was we are not the Arbiters of truth but we also saw that some types of misinformation if left completely unchecked could be incredibly dangerous and damaging and so we had to figure out when and where it might be appropriate to step in but it does put you at Twitter in the uncomfortable position position of having to kind of determine something as misinformation determine something as being a lie I don't think it's a comfortable position for companies to be in to have to arbitrate whether something is true or false but there's still a responsibility that goes along with being the place where these conversations happen we see that when platforms are hands off with dangerous speech that dangerous things happen as a result so as misinformation about the Corona virus continues to spread glob Twitter has implemented a new system to sort of highlight bogus or unverified claims so when you are in a very Public Health crisis and health emergency and individuals are looking for information that can literally be life-saving to have misinformation spreading could be the difference between life and death Anika Coler navaroli a lawyer and Senior member of the Twitter safety team helped write the company's content moderation policies in May 2020 Twitter rolled out a new system of labeling tweets deemed to be misinformation many experts called the steady stream of false information and conspiracy theories and infodemic so there was this new Intervention which was this label and I think it really did sort of change the experience and change the conversation for a lot of people because it felt like social media companies were intervening in things that they never had done before which they were speech police never met him why is it funny I you know I think it's I think it's funny to me because people have used a lot of words and a lot of phrases to kind of describe the job that I did right we were known as Twitter Gods we were known as Twitter jail and the thought police the speech police you know all of these various terms I think have been used towards you know humans who were showing up every day just trying to do our jobs what would be a better description then of what you did content moderation Twitter's new approach would play into concerns that social media companies had started to constrain what people could say about the pandemic and the response they want unquestioned obedience so they're cracking down on free expression in late April Elon Musk tweeted Silicon Valley has become sanctimonious Valley too much the moral Arbiter of the world today Governor Gavin Nome issued an executive order to send every one of Twitter's first misinformation labels would be the most fateful we are reaching out uh to all registered eligible voters and giving when California governor Gavin Newsome announced that he'd send millions of mail and ballots to voters in lockdown president Trump took to Twitter alleging this would lead to electoral fraud so in that moment we had to decide what to do we had built a new product and a new set of Technologies for labeling misinformation and here was one of the most prominent accounts on the service spreading misinformation about voting by mail and so we made the decision to use our new labeling technology on one of Donald Trump's tweets for the first time how did it feel to make that decision it was a bit like a dam breaking for years Twitter had been criticized for not doing anything to address harmful speech from Donald Trump and in truth he had kind of paralyzed the company's content moderation efforts because we didn't know what the right answer was the company was holding back it was nervous about taking its first action to moderate a sitting head of state and then we did it and the response was immediate let's bring kellyanne Conway counselor to the president the day after we labeled Donald Trump's post for the first time I woke up to Kelly and Conway on Fox News I want to raise the the name of somebody at Twitter he's the head of integrity and his name is yoel Roth he's y y o e l somebody in San Francisco go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers this I was floored I had never gotten that level of public attention before his name is yel Roth and he's the next day I was on the cover of the New York Post along with several of my old tweets the president held an oval office press conference to crying social media censorship he called me a hater if Twitter were not honorable if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think just shut it down as far as I'm concerned but I'd have to go through a legal process to do how you down I became the poster child for Silicon Valley bias and censorship Twitter's head of sight Integrity has tweeted that there are quote actual Nazis in the White House the Trump Administration pointed to tweets Roth had posted back in 2016 not long after he joined Twitter accusing him of bias this is just incredible I'm just saying we fly over those states that voted for a racist Tangerine for a reason it's obviously not decency and it's sure as hell not neutrality or objectivity what were you thinking tweeting those things I regret those tweets but do they not reveal a liberal bias I mean that's what the president was saying they reveal a liberal bias my personal opinions didn't imp Twitter's policies Twitter's policies were the product of dozens of people working on them and were subject to approval not just by me but by a team of Executives and ultimately by the company's CEO Jack dorsy I take the responsibility that goes with my job seriously I wouldn't post those things today I would recommend against others in my line of work doing so but I think taking years old posts out out of context and suggesting that they represent some type of systematic bias is a misrepresentation of the fact isn't it a legitimate question though to ask in certain circumstances whether the referee is biased I mean at Twitter the vast majority of the staff I believe lean Democratic right so isn't it a legitimate question to ask if the ref is biased I think it's a legitimate question to ask there's also no evidence that it's true now there are new Gatekeepers and more Gatekeepers than ever they're authoritarians if they're willing to censor the president they will think nothing at all of silencing you and they don't Elon Musk would Echo the concerns Silicon Valley with the San Francisco Bay area has too much influence on the world in my opinion and I say that as someone who has spent most of his life in California mostly in the Bay Area you know there's some out there who just want to shut down one side of debate or another I I think we should resist that in October 2020 concerns about bias at at Twitter would only intensify when it made an unprecedented move temporarily blocking a New York Post news story about Hunter Biden's laptop in the runup to the presidential election these oligarchs in big Tech are treating us as if we are thiefs in their authoritarian regime the Twitter had locked out a story about Hunter Biden's laptop you know they kept it from being transmitted for about a day then they locked the New York Post out of their account for two weeks it was kind of a historic moment in American censorship Matt taibi then a reporter for Rolling Stone was alarmed by the development these companies Facebook Twitter uh google/youtube they are de facto monopolies in terms of distribution they control overwhelmingly who gets to see what once you start going down that road the whole history of any sort of unfree Society in the world is that once you take a step in that direction you know it never stops it it always keeps going the Trump campaign is accusing Twitter and Facebook of censorship after the social Twitter had blocked the story due to concerns that the laptop was part of a Russian Hack and leak operation intended to disrupt the American elections it wasn't Twitter's CEO also said Twitter should have communicated better about Twitter and dorsy soon admitted that blocking the New York Post story was a mistake musk agreed suspending the Twitter account of a major news Organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate Joseph R Biden Jr is elected the 46th president of the United States winning three weeks later president Trump lost the election and Twitter continued to slap labels on his tweets and many others that spread lies about the results this morning president Trump plans to speak to thousands of his supporters between election day and January Twitter labeled more than 140 separate tweets from the president every time I put out a tweet that's even if it's totally correct totally correct I get a flag we labeled them as misinformation we restricted them we fact checked them and the president kept posting them every day the same thing the same content the same lies I am very concerned about what happens tomorrow especially given what we have been seeing on the platform for the last several months um on January 5th in a video obtained by Frontline of an internal Twitter conference call Ana navaroli warned that Trump's tweets could lead to violence and we're still confused as to when we are actually going to be able to either trigger again like a crisis or an emergency like does somebody need to be murdered for months she'd been urging top Executives to change Tac to not just label some of Trump's tweets but take them down what I was advocating before January 6th was not for the permanent suspension or permanent Banning of any one account but rather the taking down of individual content and I remember you know sending a message to a larger team and saying this was like December of 2020 um saying out loud you know if there were any other country in the world in which the leader of the elected party was contesting a open and fair election and their followers were openly calling for civil war would we do anything differently because I firmly believed given you know the other circumstances that I had worked and I had seen that we would and yet we were not acting in this specific case so your warnings basically were unheeded yes did you get a sense that part of the reluct to do anything much about Trump's tweeting before January 6 was because he was a star of Twitter very much so he was the main attraction I believe that the Twitter platform was used to incite violence on January 6th and Twitter knew about it I specifically warned them yes and nothing was done nothing was done navaroli would eventually resign Twitter's founder Jack dorsy didn't respond to our request for an interview the company has said that it had a policy of giving heads of state more latitude and that nai's account leaves out the unprecedented steps it took to respond to threats during the 2020 [Applause] election as the events unfolded on January 6th at the capital [Music] building Twitter temporarily suspended the president a 12-hour timeout but 2 Days Later Trump was at it again the president returned to Twitter and posted that he would not be attending President Biden's inauguration he posted that the American Patriots who had supported him would have a voice long into the future and that tweet lit a use and we saw that the president's rhetoric about Patriots having a voice into the future was being seen as a call to action as a promise that the president would have people's back as they protested demonstrated and even carried out acts of violence you were interpreting it as a call to arms but was it literally you know a call to Arms I want to emphasize that wasn't my interpretation that was how people received the president's statements whatever the president's intentions and we can't get in his head we don't know what he was thinking whatever his intentions the result was that lots of people interpreted it as a call to action and a call to violence and it was not possible for the company to avoid taking action any longer I got to be honest like who elected you to take away the megaphone I mean who are you to make that choice I'm no one mhm and it wasn't my decision it was my recommendation there were other people who were involved in it who reviewed it who weighed in on it but ultimately it shouldn't be any one person's decision it's a terrifying amount of power for a company to have for any one person to have whether it's me Jack dorsy Elon Musk no one should have that kind of power and yet that power exists and somebody has to make a call whether in incitement of violence from a head of state crosses the line and I didn't seek out that power I don't think anyone working at Twitter or Facebook or any other platform did but when the power finds you and when the risks are so significant there's no choice but to act this morning president Trump waking up without his favorite megaphone Twitter has announced it is cutting off president Trump's ability to post on the social media site permanently I think that big Tech is doing a horrible thing for our country the suspension of President Trump was widely criticized including by Elon Musk a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast High Tech as the DEA facto Arbiter of free speech joining us remotely Elon Musk he'd call Twitter's decision a grave mistake I do think that it was not correct to ban Donald Trump it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice I think proma bands just fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter as a Town Square uh where um everyone can uh voice their opinion musk saw Twitter's decision not as an isolated incident but part of a larger Trend in American culture I think he felt that the educational establishment the med media the people who ran Twitter had sort of fallen into a group think and he felt they were suppressing people who were outside of the mainstream especially people on the right he called it the woke mind virus he basically meant the progressive very anti- capitalistic or anti- business feelings as well as the political correctness he felt where you had to use the right pronouns and other things an episode in musk's complicated family life would intensify his feelings about Progressive politics model by 2022 he'd had 11 children with three different women that spring one of his teenagers came out publicly as transgender and he got his mind around that okay but she became very left-wing and Progressive and Marxist rejected him for being a billionaire and Chang your last name and he kept saying that's the most hurtful thing that ever happened and that too I think pushed him because he felt that the woke ideology had infected her and others and so he becomes more anti-establishment more anti-woke Elon Musk right he would later explain his disdain for woke politics to comedian and talk show host Bill Mah I mean you have talked about this woke mind virus yes it's often anti bureaucratic at you can't you can't question things even the questioning is bad almost Anonymous would we would we cancel culture okay so this I I really can't emphasize this enough we must uh uh we must protect free speech um and Free Speech only matters it's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something you don't like because obviously speech that you like is you know that's easy um so it it's uh and it's the thing about censorship is that sure for those who would advocated um just remember at some point that will be turned on you musk's tough talk about the woke mind virus and his new found free speech Crusade would help make him one of the most popular figures in America he talks about this woke mindset virus and I think he's right it is a virus he's not afraid to speak the truth he's speaking the truth very boldly he was tapping into a growing concern in much of the country that Progressive ideas and policies had gone too far at its heart wokeness is divisive um exclusionary um and hateful on Sunday evening we got a a um notice hi The Babylon B your account has been locked for violating the Twitter rules for musk the last straw was in March 2022 when Twitter suspended one of his favorite accounts The Babylon b a right-wing satirical website and our offending tweet was the Babylon be's man of the year is Rachel Lavine and you thought was was a nice honor the Babylon B had mocked the nation's highest ranking transgender official Admiral Rachel LaVine by awarding her the title Man of the Year a violation of Twitter's misgendering policy at the time Elon Musk took issue with the the Banning of uh The Babylon B you know they were taken off because they I guess misgendered um one of Biden's uh appointees a you know a transo point and I could see why people would think that's offensive but we've protected comedy in this country for a long time even when it's incredibly offensive uh precisely because you know that's where a lot of social change happens if you start making it banable to to say the wrong thing you're you're going to not have comedy soon you know it's just a joke and and and they're they're asking us to basically bend the knee and say we admit that this is hateful conduct please keep on your platform and we're not going to do that and so in the case of the Babylon B they posted content that misgendered Admiral Rachel LaVine they claimed it was satire but they did it fully recognizing that they had violated Twitter's rules you don't get to join somebody else's community and decide that you're going to set your own rules can you explain why is there a policy about misgendering if somebody expresses a preference to have somebody use one set of pronouns and somebody willfully uses another that's an attempt to silence them it's an attempt to intimidate them to abuse them to harass them and that conduct ultimately makes people less comfortable speaking publicly on a platform like Twitter which I view as counterproductive you can make that decision when you're a company and there's lots of reasons for it you do it because it attracts users you do it because it attracts advertisers you do it because certain identity categories are actually protected under the law in the United States and elsewhere and you have an obligation to do it but those are decisions that you make as a company you are curating a community and you get to decide whether some types of harmful and hateful conduct are outside of the bounds of what's okay when Babylon B was suspended musk's ex-wife texted him a suggestion can you buy Twitter and then delete it please XX America is going insane please do something to fight woke is M I will do anything to help XX musk tested the waters on Twitter given that Twitter serves as the deao Public Town Square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done at the beginning of 2022 things are going really well for him he had a lot of money burning a hole in his pocket cuz he had exercised some stock options but when things go well for musk he gets unsettled sometimes he wants to shake things up he's been as his brother Kimble says a drama addict his whole life and when things are calm he seeks out storms by March musk had been quietly buying Twitter stock hoping to push the company in a New Direction he told me this could fulfill my vision of x.com which was the company had started 20 years earlier that morphed into PayPal but he had wanted it to be larger than a PayPal he wanted it to be a social network a payments platform a place place where everybody could create content and get paid for it he wanted to transform content the way Steve Jobs transformed the music business Twitter offered him a seat on the board in texts with perog Agarwal Jack dorsey's new CEO musk seemed eager to help I have a ton of ideas but let me know if I'm pushing too hard I just want Twitter to be maximum amazing in the midst of the turmoil of him buying stock and being offered a board seat on Twitter he flies off to Hawaii doesn't usually take vacations but this is three or 4 days at Larry Ellison's house and he's meeting a girl he was seeing at the time Natasha Basset an Australian actress but instead of relishing the vacation he stays up all night tweeting and texting most of these top accounts tweet rarely and post very little content is Twitter dying it was the day musk was is set to join the board Agarwal texted him you are free to tweet is Twitter dying or anything else about Twitter but it's my responsibility to tell you that it's not helping me make Twitter better in the current context musk snapped back what did you get done this week less than a minute later I'm not joining the board this is a waste of time 15 seconds after that we'll make an offer to take Twitter private elon's impatience and impulsiveness just drove him to say I don't want a board seat I want to control this musk made his offer $43 billion all cash take it or leave it he tweeted the news about an hour ago simply saying quote I made an offer Elon Musk wants Twitter but he doesn't got it yet this is not only a big wi for free speech it is about a big ship that's coming he says he wants to transform the company Caris swisser was initially optimistic I thought it was a great idea I thought he'd be a good owner why um because he has the money the means and the creativity to do something I thought he um I thought he could get stuff done and he actually asked me my ideas because I knew a lot about Twitter I was a very heavy user I was working with Twitter on a bunch of things that were were interesting to make money and I was very clear like you can do it you can make this into much better business and he said let's get together and talk about it yeah so we heard musk this afternoon say he's not sure that this will succeed not all of his friends and family were so enthusiastic in early April he's at the factory in Texas for Tesla and his brother is arguing don't get into Twitter you got enough else to do even his kids at dinner are saying why are you doing this his kids say we don't use Twitter I just sat and watched as all these arguments were going on but I did ask him how does it fit in to all your other missions and he said well it doesn't really fit in but maybe by helping democracy it'll help civilization survive I think he always has to put these things in some huge large epic framework and he eventually convinced himself of that my biological neuronet concluded that if putter was not bought and steered in a good direction that it would be a danger for the future of civilization he is somebody ever since he was reading comic books as a kid who needs to see himself on an epic [Applause] mission after Twitter accepted his offer musk appeared celebratory at the Met Galla with his mother I told him not to Take On The World and the universe and he didn't listen aspirationally I am trying to do good for uh humanity and and the future of civilization throughout all of this I really thought he has bought some Twitter stock he's talked about buying Twitter what are the odds that he will actually get his act together there's a gap between like Elon Musk tweeting I'm going to buy this company or like sending a angry text message saying I want to buy your company and like the bankers at Morgan Stanley putting together the commitment letter saying here's your $44 billion of financing did it appear like an Impulse buy I would have said more like a rage by it didn't on the surface seem to have a ton of like lot like business or Financial logic to it one reason it seems impulsive is cuz he changed his mind like a week later you know like he tried to get out of the deal Elon Musk now backing out of his $44 billion agreement to purchase Twitter the social media giant suing him for $44 billion in an effort to enforce their original merger agreement Does Elon Musk have any legal footing here maybe I think that probably what was happening there was mostly that he realized he was overpaying no one really knows but I think that probably what he was looking to do was recut the deal at a lower price probably musk hinting of a new era of Twitter earlier this week after several months of legal wrangling musk gave up agreeing to the terms of his original offer Deon musk is in control of Twitter this morning the world's richest man closed his Blockbuster deal overnight to take now that it's no longer a publicly traded company he'll have no shareholders to answer to which means he can run the company how he wants on October 26th 2022 Elon Musk arrived at Twitter headquarters with a gag in hand I was standing in the lobby with parag goal and some of the leaders of Twitter they were waiting for mus to come in and then he comes in with that sink entering Twitter HQ let that sink in you could feel a certain tension in the air because Twitter is this caring comforting environment with all sorts of quiet rooms and yoga studios and mental health days and they believe in psychological safety and must turn to me and said psychological safety and he sort of laughs he says that's the enemy of innovation I believe in hardcore intensity musk had taken on more than 12 billion in debt and needed to start making Cuts quickly he'd brought with him a team of friends relatives and Loyalists from his other companies to help them do just that suddenly an army of people materialized in the office who didn't have Twitter name tags or Twitter computers and who started telling Twitter staff what to do and the Assumption was that they had some kind of authority because Elon had brought them over they knew how to build cars they knew how to launch rockets they knew how to dig tunnels but they didn't necessarily know about how to run a social media company teams were asked originally to print out out code I think 50 pages of code and have it reviewed by a Tesla engineer people were standing at the printer printing out their code and sort of standing in line like a bunch of students about to be reprimanded by a dean and that whole exercise is not valuable Engineers who build cars do not understand the code behind social media systems they're they're totally different things that was just a performance of loyalty within days ran was part of the first round of layoffs everyone's rolling okay we spoke to a group of former employees some of whom told us they'd been initially excited by the prospect of musk taking over I was what I would initially call team hype um when he was first offered to buy the company and then in early June we had an all hands with him Elon thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me glad to be able to speak to everyone a leaked video of the meeting was posted online I like okay I'm going to see the business version of el monks not the weird Twitter guy right and we're going to hear like facts about his product vision and we're going to hear a bunch of stuff around that he showed up late to that meeting he showed up in a very unprofessional manner made joke already but uh you know some people use their hair to express themselves I use Twitter um the meeting was very Meandering it was very light on details that some of my some of my comments about Twitter being sort of like a digital Town Square um but really much more than that it was going into AI he talked about extending the light of Consciousness and start to get like Mars colonization we should take the set of actions most likely to uh extend the scope scale and lifespan of Consciousness as we know it um and uh can't believe that's the transition from Aliens away away from this conversation back to uh to Twitter what I guess I didn't quite hear at that meeting what I thought what I would see a very professional kind of visionary or industrialist I just saw the same Twitter guy Elon Musk making major moves after his takeover at Twitter telling employees layoffs will begin later this morning a week after musk's takeover the entire Twitter staff received an email 5 5:30 on Thursday which is 8:00 people have left for the day on the East Coast Central Time this note about oh here Way's going to happen you'll get an email either to your work email or your personal email I remember over text with half my team and we were literally refreshing like we were logging into our computers I'm on the East Coast I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. that night like just kind of checking like do I still have access and then at 3:00 a.m. I was like you know what I'll find out in the morning if I'm still an employee I was having dinner with my family and I'm on the East Coast um and my phone was just dinging uh during the dinner I opened my computer and when I logged in I lost access like everything shut off the screen went gray at that moment and I literally started crying in front of my kids it could have been handled a whole lot better should have been handled a whole lot better and with more humanity and so shame on him for that I spent over an an hour and a half I don't know why I'm so emotional I thought I'm over this so I lied on in bed and and I scroll to the top of the of the timeline and I looked at everybody's message I scrolled over about 9 hours worth of saluting emojis and the next day is like you went through a fire and you're looking for survivors this morning thousands of Twitter employees are out of a job there'd be more rounds of layoffs and firings over the coming months it felt like I was on a sinking ship they had just let like 75% of the people on the ship drown and I'm still here on this ship and I'm like don't know what I'm doing oh and how how many of you even by a show of hands are still waiting on a proper Severance what you were promised really all of you thousands of former workers have sued Twitter raising claims including unpaid Severance and bonuses Twitter contends its ex-employees have received everything they owed Twitter customers support At Your [Laughter] Service musk defended the layoffs on the Silicon Valley podcast Allin on balance how did you get to your intuition on what the efficient Frontier of employees needed to be to make the product better well um yeah I I I observed part of this where you basically ask the question who here is critical and who here is exception yes I mean so I mean really the what the criteria trying to apply and obviously you're not going to be perfect um if you're moving fast and and there's a lot of you know people you're talking about here is that anyone who is exceptional at what they do where the role is critical and they have a positive effect uh on others um and they are trusted meaning they put the company's interests before their own uh should stay pretty straightforward yeah and and you know also and also is up for working you know working hard like uh that would not that would not these that's not was not Twitter's prior culture the first time that I met Elon Musk was a few hours after he fired my boss I assumed that I was going to be fired and was frankly surprised that it was happening in person but a member of elon's Team requested to meet with me so the initial perspective that somebody on his team had was well turn off all access to content moderation tools just stop all of it nobody moderates anything really and I explained that that wouldn't be a viable approach because there's lots of types of moderation that are simply non-negotiable around combating terrorism around protecting children I suggested that we not shut down those lines of work and he agreed and I was just floored there was a moment that i' had been expecting not just to be fired but to be walked out the door immediately and instead I was making a recommendation to Elon Musk about content moderation he agreed with me and he understood what we were trying to do and I thought for a minute maybe it won't be as bad as we've been assuming maybe it's all just for show hate speech is surging on Twitter following Elon musk's takeover despite musk would soon be tested he put up the bat signal to racist to misogynists to homophobes groups that monitor hate speech like the Anti-Defamation League spotted a worrying Trend we saw this surge of toxic trolling and hate speech that just blew up on the platform days after the company was bought there was a trolling campaign that was supposedly testing the waters of the new Twitter the idea was that trolls should come to the platform and post racist content as proof that Elon was now allowing racism in a way that the previous administration didn't and so there was a surge in racism a coalition of groups including the ADL called on big advertisers to pause spending on Twitter this growing list of companies pressing pause on their Twitter ads Audi's leaving uh GM is leaving fer is leaving we wanted clarification on how the company was thinking about its policies around addressing hate and harassment on its service the tactic of working with advertisers and pressuring advertisers is essentially a tactic of like let's hit them where it hurts I mean advertising is their main Revenue stream like Proctor and Gamble and Unilever and craft and cocacola and McDonald's and Starbucks I mean these businesses invest billions of billions of dollars in their brands they spend countless amounts of money to try to connect with consumers and all we want to do is make sure they understand that their brands are being you know flighted up on these sites next to I don't know swas stickers or next to white supremacist content or next to other hateful content and then look if McDonald's thinks or cocacola thinks that they want their ads up against you know horrible racist content they can they can do that the day Elon officially took over the use of the nword on Twitter shot up 500% and so there's this question of whether or not trolls or or or different people are testing the limits of what is appropriate on Twitter and I think it tells you all you need to know about how musk's messaging and his signaling has been received how as hate speech continued to Surge musk called in yoel Roth who is now leading Twitter's trust and Safety Division my directions from Elon directly were shut it down get rid of all of it he actually even wanted us to go further than we had previously and said it's not just about targeted hateful conduct attacks on somebody he's like just take all of this stuff down get rid of the slurs get rid of all of it and he pushed us to take a more aggressive position shutting down free speech he was doing it out of a recognition that advertisers objected to this content and we're judging him and the new Twitter by our ability to effectively moderate it but as advertisers continued to stay away and revenue plummeted musk suddenly changed course and began pushing back Twitter has had a massive drop in Revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists extremely messed up they're trying to destroy free speech in America inside Twitter he asked Roth and his team to block posts supporting the advertising pause one of the things that was very hypocritical in my view is that you had people urging boycotts because they thought Twitter was allowing too much hate speech and must decided he wanted to shut down some of these people who are advocating a boycott well that goes against Free Speech principles that's pure political speech and yoel Roth and other people there said you can't do that I was spending more and more of my time each day dealing with impulsive and erratic questions and decisions and feeling that I was becoming less and less effective in pushing back on them I would get questions about conspiracy theories about Twitter's moderation and would have to spend hours answering them I managed to push back on some of elon's requests to ban users outside of our policies but I was sort of left wondering at what point does that not work anymore at what point does he not listen to me at what point do I get fired for this and I realized that pushing back on individual bad decisions wasn't going to be enough and so I quit is this working Hey guys you're on too welcome this is me curling a 45 oh my gosh with yel Roth gone along with much of the trust and safety team musk was remaking Twitter in his own image here we are uh at the at the merch thing and there's an entire closet full of hash woke in late November he announced a general amnesty for many accounts Twitter had previously suspended and reinstated The Babylon B former president Donald Trump and Neo-Nazi Andrew angan he basically turned back on a lot of people people who' previously been banned from the platform the kind of Bad actors who were using Twitter to abuse people to bully people to intimidate people again to propagate antisemitism and anti-black racism and fairly awful stuff musk defended the amnesty stating that the company was using its algorithms to ensure that even if hateful content was posted on Twitter that content would not get seen by many users there's more of an allowance for what you what some might call hate speech on the system but it's just it's not going to be promoted it's not like we're not going to be recommending hate speech just at risk of stating the obvious he argued that the critical thing to tackle was hate speech Impressions the number of times a tweet actually shows up on someone's timeline or search results you're you're doing a lot more to take down hate speech than the company was doing yeah absolutely hb's impressions are down by a third and will get even um lower but this claim was almost impossible to verify I think there was a moment shortly after I left Twitter when the company said that every week they would put out new data about the prevalence of hate speech to the contrary Twitter is actually cut back on the level of data available to researchers who want to study the platform Twitter went from being one of the most transparent companies to to one of the least the Twitter verse exploding over that controversial tweet posted part of Twitter's problem was musk himself he deleted that tweet but not before got more than a 100,000 likes and his tweets at times became dark and conspiratorial just 48 hours after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi in San Francisco Elon Musk Twitter's new CEO tweeted out a conspiracy theory about the attack there's a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye the article questions Mr Pelosi's sexuality even suggesting he may have known his attacker San Francisco was so homophobic it was crazy here's the owner of Twitter retweeting misinformation about an attack on a man in in an anti-gay way I I was like who does this and then it got just weird and mean like constant attacks constant retweeting misinformation then he started doing transphobic stuff he's got a kid who's trans that was like shocking and so it just went on and on and on and on and it was like what in the world happened to you musk deleted the post about Paul Pelosi and would later apologize but the controversial tweets kept coming he would stay up late drink Red Bull take ambient sometimes he would get into this dark demon mode and that's when the very paranoid or conspiratorial tweets came out one day he was traveling with a friend Antonio gracius and musk had kept tweeting late at night doing these ridiculous tweets sometimes very harmful ones and so the friend said let me take your phone and I'm going to put it in the safe here in the hotel room friend punches in the code he said that way you can't use it late at night at 3: in the morning musk calls hotel security to get him to open the safe and he starts doing tweets he was addicted to tweeting late one night in the workroom at Twitter with some of his young cousins they all got kind of Giddy and were joking and at one point somebody suggested hey make your pronouns prosecute fouchy now this is something that could both insult uh people who trans insult Anthony fouchy but they all started laughing about it and then finally mus tweeted it out my pronouns are prosecute [Music] fouchy that tweet infuriated people around him it infuriated his girlfriend it infuriated his brother it showed Elon Musk was skittering a bit around that deep Rabbit Hole of conspiracy theories he wants to erode the very fabric of civilization Soros hates Humanity one night musk tweeted about George Soros the Jewish billionaire and frequent Target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories he described him as like magn Mago of course Magneto is a comic book character from X-Men who was a Jewish Survivor himself but Magneto seeks to destroy humanity and when you suggest that someone like Soros a real person wants to do something like that and we've seen how it leads to violence when we use words carelessly it can create consequences and that's what deeply troubled me about what Elon said you know people today are saying he's an anti Semite I'm like a pro Semite on CNBC musk was asked why he continued to risk his business and his brand there a scene in The Princess Bride great movie great um where he confronts the person who killed his father he says offer me money offer me power I don't care I'll say what I want to say and if if if uh the consequence of that is losing money so be it musk's tweets had the power to Marshall an army of followers shortly after he left the company yoel Roth found out what it was like to be on the receiving end when a false accusation surfaced on Twitter that Roth condoned pedophilia musk chimed in Elon Musk with more than 100 million Twitter followers receiv responds to these insinuations that I condone pedophilia and he says this explains a lot the threats against me went from being you're biased and you deserve to die to being you're a child molester and you deserve to die you're trafficking children and you deserve to die I think he's a sexual deviant it seems like a lot of these people that were on Twitter seem to be um child enthusiasts that's the kind of guy that was censoring you that guy that should frighten everybody The Daily Mail went further and published where I live and so at that point it was not just threatening emails and texts and phone calls it was the very real possibility that somebody could show up at my house there were people emotionally activated to fight against a cabal of pedophiles with me apparently as their ring leader I mean what was it like for you for the first time in a long time I was terrified I was no stranger to being harassed online but I feared for my life what would you say to musk in reaction to doing something like that to using his position his power in that way I think there's so many ways that somebody with Elon musk's resources influence and ability to reach the public could Advance the public conversation on issues that matter but to use his power to terrorize a former employee to baselessly accuse a gay man of being a pedophile one of the oldest most offensive most dangerous tropes out there it's inhumane as the attacks on yel Roth continued musk embarked on a new campaign he began to suspend some Twitter users he took issue with for years there has been a Twitter account Elon jet it has been posting where elon's jet is this is public information Elon has hated this Elon jet account and then Elon claimed someone had been stalking his son hi hi hi a stalker came by where he was staying in Los Angeles and he thought well maybe it's cuz they tracked us on Elon jet last night car carrying Lil X in La was followed by crazy stalker who later blocked car from moving and climbed onto Hood if there's one thing sure to trigger Elon Musk it's a threat to his kids and especially this kid X so he shuts down El jet Twitter account Elon jet suspended I did the appeal thing and I just like said you know I don't believe I violated any terms which is surprising given that he's talking about free speech on the platform except if you track where he goes on his private plane in response mus tweeted realtime posting of someone else's location violates doxing policy doxing is revealing the Identity or location or address of an individual online a number of journalists posted links to the public flight pattern that anyone can find and Elon got rid of those people too International criticism raining down on the billionaire after the social network suspended several journalists the Washington posts Drew Harwell the New York times's Ryan Mack and CNN's Donnie Ulan have fallen prey to Twitter's blocking spree he shut down any journalist who had referred to or linked to Elon Jet and it made no sense it really was a violation of this notion of free speech soon musk was prohibiting users from posting links to a rival site as well Twitter suspending accounts of upstart rival service masteron this all comes one month after musk proclaimed he wanted Twitter to be a place of free speech and would Grant quote amnesty to all previously banned accounts and reinstate them I thought that that was hypocritical the idea that Elon is some kind of hero against doxing take some kind of stand against publishing people's personal information is complete and total nonsense reporter Lynette Lopez who' been attacked by musk and his followers before took to Twitter with her criticism within a day she too found herself locked out with no explanation I always say that Elon is a Law and Order guy as long as he writes the laws and gives the orders that's how he felt about free speech on Twitter love Free Speech as long as the speech is mine and I have the freedom to say whatever I want but there were a lot of people on Twitter who didn't seem to get that same respect what he's doing it's like whack-a-mole he sees something and he's going to smack it down but how do you broadly enforce that critics calling the move dangerous and hypocritical amid the criticism musk ran a Twitter poll and ultimately backtracked on the suspensions has been Global backlash after Elon musk's Twitter suspended the accounts of several journalists on Thursday all in podcast now SP even some of musk's allies on the podcast Allin were now questioning his judgment he came in and did exactly what the old regime did which is that he took the rules and he took the quote moderation policies and he found a way to use them to make some editorialized decisions that he thought was appropriate I think that hopefully he gets all this under control over there he finds a good executive team I would like to see him get back to Landing rockets on barges getting to Mars let's getting finish self driving we're almost there musk appeared to be listening after watching the World Cup final with Jared Kushner he asked his followers to respond to another poll should I step down as head of Twitter I will abide by the results of this poll 57% of Voters said yes musk should step down 3 days later he sounded deflated this company is is like like basically you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed uh with the engines on fire and the controls don't work musk said he was going to stay on until he could find a new seat EO but he'd continue to make impulsive decisions Super Bowl Sunday has arrived and Elon Musk flies on his private jet to the Super Bowl he's sitting in the stand watching the game well you got some Brilliant Minds in that photo rert Murdoch Elon Musk and he tweets out basically his support for the Philadelphia Eagles I think his tweet was something like go eagles with a few American flags on it Biden around the same time posts a somewhat similar to tweet Fly Eagles Fly and it's a video of his wife Joel Biden who's walking with an eagles Jersey on the game goes on Elon Musk checks his phone weird it looks like Joe Biden who he's called a damp sock puppet in human form is doing much better than he is in terms of engagement on this very similar tweet Zoe shiffer and her colleague at platformer spoke to multiple sources at Twitter about what happened next by the end of the game the Eagles lose and Elon is completely Furious like something is going on with his account in his mind and so he gets on his jet he flies straight back to Twitter's office in San Francisco at 2:36 a.m. she says an Urgent Message went out and roughly 80 Engineers were pulled into work and they're tasked with fixing the issues with the algorithm what the engineers decide to do do is reconfigure the algorithm so that Elon musk's account is boosted very quickly we're able to talk to people who were in the room at the time and were working on these algorithmic changes and the reason that people are talking to us is that people are pissed at this point the effect was immediate if you use Twitter and you feel like you've been seeing a lot of Alon musk lately you're not crazy the entire four you feed was just Elon Musk because it behooves all of us to be privy to the fresh and original insights of the richest man in the world I was seeing so much Elon and then I tweeted is anyone else's For You tab like just Elon Musk today and it was like hundreds of people were like yes like what is happening musk posted a provocative meme he then denied his tweets had been deliberately boosted at all and blamed a glitch in the algorithm for what had happened so what was it like to observe that going from this free speech soluti who's upset about how Twitter had been wielding its power now he's in charge it seems like he's at this point he's like a king who wants to make up his own rules you know musk feels I'm going to be free I'm not going to be restrained and it can not be a pretty sight at times but that's the musk that also gets things done he's always wanted to be king of the playround amid the chaos of his first months running Twitter musk made another impulsive decision that would reverberate across American politics and have far-reaching implications for free speech online the Twitter files on Free Speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself the public deserves to know what really happened as always he announced it with a tweet are you doing all the people together or you have to musk had assembled a team of writers critical of the mainstream media and given them access to a trove of internal documents in an effort to to expose how Twitter had censored users before he bought it Matt taiii was the first person musk brought in did you come in with any degree of skepticism you know what was his real motivation here what was he using you in some way of course I worried about that of course I worried is he is he using me but what I decided from the beginning was I want to look at the material if the stuff in there looks like it can be confirmed I'm just going to focus on that and I'm not going to worry about his motivations as long as I feel like the stuff in the stories is is right taiii and the team combed through thousands of company emails and internal Communications they started publishing a series of controversial stories known as the Twitter files in the words of Elon Musk here we go he alerted his 119 million followers to a long thread called the Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files most major news organizations were skeptical of the Twitter files potentially what is being presented is selective Twitter employees knew what they were doing was but Fox News seized on them it wasn't a Smoking Gun it was a flaming Howitzer some of the most explosive stories revealed that Twitter deplatformed and de Amplified certain users and content apparently I'm on the list sometimes at the request of government I uh wrote a tweet that began it doesn't stop infection or transmission and they banned me we know for a fact that the White House singled out Alex baronson a reporter uh skeptical of the co vaccine uh to be taken down and they deplatformed him that's so far beyond the bounds of what's acceptable Michael shellenberger a writer known for his contentious positions on climate nuclear and Drug policies was part of the project I think the whole point of having a platform is supposed to be reflective of a society and that's going to allow a lot of different views including ones that we disagree with and ones that we think are outright lies it's the whole point of free speech actually a right to be wrong a right to disagree a right to spread you know one person's misinformation is another person's point of view Yol Roth who is this guy yoel Roth was once again singled out Neel Roth again ironically the global head of trust and safety he was accused of secretly suppressing users deemed to be spreading misinformation his name is y Roth Yol Roth you may not know you'll Roth but you need to a lot of people didn't know about George Soros a long time ago were these people getting filtered were they getting you know was were these systems used to basically downgrade their reach yes and Twitter said it would do that in the help center in the Twitter rules when accounts violated the Twitter rules whether it was posting coid misinformation or election misinformation if they did it repeatedly they might get a label like do not amplify on their account account would they know about that they wouldn't Twitter didn't disclose those labels publicly because it didn't have the tools for doing so and I I think that's a reasonable criticism but people act like the whole practice was a mystery and was a conspiracy it wasn't it was in the rules the rules explicitly stated that accounts that violated the rules would receive visibility filtering and they did but I mean address the point directly of of that you were secretly suppressing specific viewpoints especially on the right I don't think that's what the Twitter files show and I don't know that we've done a comprehensive analysis that demonstrates that these actions were skewed or biased one way or the other I think we've seen a handful of cherry-picked examples now I think there's a reasonable question to ask whether accounts on the left and on the right had the same rate of violation of the Twitter rules do Democrats Break The Rules as often as Republicans I don't know that's a really good question that should be studied but when you see a handful of examples of it and conclude that those must be the only types of accounts that received visibility filtering I just I don't think there's enough evidence there to support that conclusion the real winner in this is Elon Musk right he's making Elon Musk was delighted with the controversy even though he was using his own methods to suppress content he didn't like almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned out to be true so like is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter that didn't turn out to be true so far they've all turned out to be true and if not more true than people thought the Twitter files team went on to publish portions of emails to Twitter from government agencies and academic institutions that were flagging potential misinformation about vaccines and voting as well as possible foreign efforts to disrupt elections the messages asked Twitter to review the content and consider taking action musk's team claimed it was evidence of a conspiracy to censor Americans Twitter files journalists say the uncovered a sensorship industrial complex they called it a censorship industrial complex the degree to which uh various government agencies had effectively had full access to everything that was going on on Twitter uh blew my mind that's a big claim right that is a big claim to say that there's a censorship industrial complex it also sort of implies that the government is successfully exerting its influence on these companies to infringe upon the First Amendment rights of Americans well I would AR I think they are I think that's probably the case mhm yeah when you say probably the case you mean what I mean is it is it technically against the law I don't know whether it's technically a First Amendment violation it's censorship to me I just think that the fact that they're doing it at all is maybe not legitimate I definitely don't want the Department of Homeland Security making decisions about what can be published and what can't be published or what's going to be Amplified or not Amplified well they're not making decisions they're sending requests as you said to these companies like Twitter right I just don't I don't want them involved at all in doing that and I I don't think I'm alone um I think a lot of people feel the same way according to the Twitter files team a keep part of the so-called censorship industrial complex was a group of academics running a project called the election Integrity partnership I just read the election Integrity committee I get super suspicious oh yeah just the just the name of that I mean Joe they basically would flag hundreds of millions of tweets and tens of millions of them were censored the claims that we tried to censor I think I've seen anywhere from 22 million to 800 million tweets that is a staggering number of tweets there is no Universe in which that could have happened and there is no evidence in the Twitter files that it did because it didn't Renee Desta helped run the election Integrity partnership which was set up in 2020 by academics and researchers studying the problem of misinformation its purpose was to flag election misinformation to Platforms in government both of which were coming under increasing pressure to deal with the issue the goal of it is not to disenfranchise or silence or censor anybody the goal of it is to ensure that the best possible information is out there so that the public can see it and if there had been emails in which we were demanding platforms take things down the Twitter files investigators could have released those but they didn't because they don't exist dur resta's role in the partnership was held out as proof of the so-called conspiracy due to her work as an advis ER to the Senate intelligence committee and her background as a CIA intern one of the big leaders of the censorship industrial complex is this person named Renee Desta it is very hard to get people angry about a concept it is not as hard to rile them up about a person Renee Desta a former CIA fellow at least allegedly former I think she's dangerous and needs to be disempowered Michael shenberger used me and he made me the face of this thing and he took the fact that you know I had interned for the agency as an undergrad which had never been a secret and he somehow turned it into part of a vast cabal you get turned into a character what's that been like well uh it leads to death threats it leads to harassment and it is very very hard for me to refute any of it because in the environment that we live in people who trust Michael schellenberger are going to be disinclined to trust me the Twitter files um claim to kind of uncover this sort of Coalition y right between folks like yourself the academic portion of this government and big Tech and that essentially this all adds up to a censorship industrial complex so what on the face of it what are we supposed to make of that claim well I mean on the face of it there's no actual evidence for it in the Twitter files is the thing that that's been the most remarkable piece to the whole thing is that the evidence does not appear in the Twitter files but you know there's always this grain of truth that provides the seed on which a conspiracy can be built and so is it true that um you know that our team briefs the government yes yes it is is it true that our team talks to Twitter and Facebook occasionally yes we do um that's never been a secret does that translate into we talk to them about the need to take down conservative no absolutely not critics are saying that musk and his allies are misrepresenting the work of Twitter's former management T also admitted that the Trump campaign asked for Content moderation and then he left those links out what is taiii doing there's a lot of omission in the Twitter FS a lot you and your colleagues don't tell us you mentioned in passing for example in your very first thread that the Trump White House made requests of Twitter 2 as the writers of the Twitter files kept publishing they were criticized for multiple factual errors quoting emails without context and jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions do you know what the 22 million number is Matt can you tell me because we checked 22 million came after the election it wasn't in the runup they flagged 3,000 so you were off by 2,997 they said a lot of things I I I stand by my story I've got to ask you because I mean you know both fellow journalists and some of the subjects of your reporting have called out some inaccuracies in the reporting um I mean what what happened there were you were you sloppy with some facts yeah how does that not affect the credibility of what you're going for here I mean I've been doing this for 30 years if you go back and look at my record I haven't had to issue a whole lot of Corrections in my life I try extremely hard to get everything correct in this case we got a few things wrong musk's Twitter files didn't end up proving a grand conspiracy but they did fuel a larger conversation about the relationship between government and social media companies and raised important questions about the extent to which government has been pressuring platforms to remove content we welcome our Witnesses and thank them for appearing today we will Begin by swearing you in would you please stand and raise your right hand Matt taibe and Michael shellenberger were called to testify by Republican Congressman Jim Jordan a trump supporter who for years has insisted that big Tech has been biased against conservatives that is until Elon Musk bought Twitter I mean God bless him we wouldn't know any of this but for the fact that this guy hard workor smart guy who just amazing success story who decided to go by Twitter because he cares so much about the first amendment I think he's been just amazingly transparent and God bless him for doing it now we all know why you guys said at the outset this is the most chilling story and you guys are New York Times bestsellers award-winning uh journalist but in all your your time in the in the journalism field this issue most important and how this I think what' you call it Mr shellberg this complex what' you call it the censorship industrial complex totally this web of censorship big government big Tech NOS all this web of censorship that's what this committee is going to get to and that's not right or left this is just right or wrong this is wrong we know it's wrong and it's about protecting the first amendment when you say that big government is colluding with tech companies like Twitter to censor people what do you mean by censor what ises it what does it actually mean take down political speech um you know take down speech that you that governments labeled as misinformation you step back and you think that's not supposed to be how it works in America but yet that is in fact what was going on you have multiple examples of that uh you know take DS down can you work on removing this one what's happening are you limiting the visibility of this one all from the government to a private company well you say it it's a private company so doesn't the private company ultimately make the decision as to what they choose to promote or suppress or take down you can't have this censorship industrial complex and then get away with saying oh but by the way it wasn't us doing it it was the private company do you think that the government has a role in working with the tech companies to prevent foreign interference with elections what what we're uh what we're focused on primarily is the limitations on political speech this idea that um you know other people who had a different view on certain uh aspects of how um the country dealt with the coid uh pandemic and and the vaccine issue that they were censored um that's our big concern is protecting the first amendment when you start having the government tell you what is misinformation disinformation or the scariest one of all Mal information Mal information is it's true statements but we don't like the context we don't like what people take from that so we're going to we're going to censor that too that is really frightening but again though I'm on the specific issues though in terms of foreign disinformation right do you agree that's a threat yeah no one no one appreciates that no one likes that no one wants that happening but the first amendment is the first amendment you several former Twitter employees were called to testify including Ana ker naari I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment and the federal government is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans Mr chairman do you think that what you were engaged in Twitter with censorship no I was censorship is done by the government and I've never worked for a government entity the American First Amendment is very clear on who it applies to right the very first words are Congress shall make no law right it is not about private companies it is not about Twitter it is not about Facebook it is not about any of these you know private companies making decisions about speech right companies are have always been allowed to do these things they've always been allowed to regulate their rules and make rules and decide what you can and can't say now Mr Roth you were part of the secretive sip pest censorship team at Twitter correct no sir I'm not sure what that refers to not surprisingly yel Roth came under Fire Mr Roth while at Twitter how many meetings did you have with the FBI I couldn't say for sure but I would say than 10 that's a reasonable estimate I couldn't say for sure more than 50 that seems a bit high in your experience did the federal government use its power to coer Twitter to make decisions about content moderation no do I know whether it was the Federal government's intention to coers the platform no I have no idea but I know that in practice there were no decisions that Twitter made that were the product of a demand from the US government or from any other government to remove content or censor content or restrict content related to the election Twitter made those decisions independently if you step back from it though and you you see the amount of interactions that there were between you and the government agencies FBI and others I mean is there anything potentially problematic about how tight a relationship that was I think it would be a problem if the government were involved in the policing of speech but it's not what happened in reality and in fact the Twitter files show again and again that when we receive requests we evaluate them against our rules and if the conduct violates our policies we enforce them and if it doesn't we don't and if the reports came from the FBI we evaluated them the same way that we would if they came from the DNC the RNC a member of Congress or an ordinary user you know the FBI is a little bit different than you know even the DNC complaining about something it's the FBI right when the FBI comes knocking it's naive to think that that doesn't have some sort of an effect right I mean the fact that they're sending a request might be coercive just by doing so I disagree if you look at the Twitter files you see again and again that my team and I pushed back on the FBI on DHS on anyone who brought us something that wasn't true and wasn't valid Jim Jordan's investigation has also targeted former government officials you're the poster child for censorship yeah yeah even though I never had any intention uh or desire to censor anyone back in April 2022 Nina janowitz was appointed to lead a new board inside the Department of Homeland Security part of a broader Push by the Biden Administration to respond to misinformation in the wake of the pandemic and lies about the 2020 election it was called the disinformation governance board I mean the name is pretty bad right I think it evokes a lot of um kind of you know authoritarian Vibes to it and I understand why people would shiver when they heard it but the idea of the name wasn't that it would be governing all of disinformation in the country it was that it would be governing the Department's response to disinformation when the new board was announced Elon Musk quickly weighed in this is messed up what was the board going to do and what was DHS going to do about disinformation it's less sexy than it might seem we never had any intention of censoring but we as any government agency does look at social media to understand what is happening and in some cases you know with uh things relating to the security of the Homeland elections infrastructure borders uh natural disasters there might be narratives of concern and what the department would then do likely although we never got to this point right we would likely put out good information the problem was the department didn't communicate well at all about uh what the board was and what was filled into that vacuum was a bunch of Lies Nina jankowitz who's like a total idiot obviously this woman is a clear Democrat supporting authoritarian there are concerns from critics about this new executive director Nina Jen as the controversy grew janowitz herself came under attack I want to be clear that it wasn't just criticism this was an allegation that the board was going to be a minister of Truth and that it would have the power to send quote men with guns to the homes of Americans who expressed opinions that the government didn't like that is what Tucker Carlson said about the board and about me men with guns plan to quote identify individuals who could be descending into violence could be descending when a conservative commentator on Twitter compared the disinformation board to Nazi Germany Elon Musk weighed in Elon Musk says the idea that the feds will watch what we say and believe is one thing only discomforting all's well that's or well how did Elon Musk contribute to the controversy swirling around you and the governance board every time Elon Musk responded to any of the conspiracy theories about the board or about me there's almost certainly a bump in the harassment and threats that I received when musk responds to something with his millions of followers it by Nature then kind of surfaces that tweet the backlash put an end to the disinformation governance board before it even got off the ground but the threats continued they really ran the gamut uh a lot of people saying um that I had been committed treason and should pay the price people threatening my child uh who at that point was unborn I was a few weeks away from giving birth um my family and I were doxed so our address was released multiple times I had a private security consultant looking at the dark web for me and he advised me at that point that I probably shouldn't be doing things like going to the coffee shop alone or getting gas alone Jim Jordan's committee accused janowitz of leading an unamerican attempt to establish a de facto Ministry of Truth within the federal government do you think that there have been legitimate questions asked about where the line should be when it comes to the government's role in working on disinformation I think those are reasonable questions that deserve to be discussed in a really nuanced and nonpartisan Manner and that is not what we have having had conversations with people like representative Jim Jordan and Matt Gates because they subpoenaed me and I had to go to a deposition I don't believe that they think that the government is actually censoring people I think that the intention of the campaign against disinformation researchers is to give the Republic party more leeway in how it presents the truth the idea is that they can certainly play fast and loose with uh with the truth and I think that benefits them as we've seen with 2020 January 6th etc etc Congressman Jordan Take a Bow sir you helped get rid of the ministry of Truth um thank you for doing that what do you have to say to the people that believe that this investigation one is creating a chilling effect that will enable people to to spread lies about election Integrity in 2024 and let me ask you no no no I just I think you're going to have to address it and the fact of the matter is address I just can't believe you're asking the question why is that because it's listen I mean the January 6 committee right they they the report said you were a significant player in Trump's efforts to overturn the election results following his defeat and according to the report you participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials what no I mean why is this laughable no because you're saying you're saying that that us investigating the sensorship of speech by Americans is going to have a chilling effect and it's like you've got it backwards they chilled speech big Tech big government press take down these tweets take down this material that's the chilling impact on speech because it doesn't get done and now you're trying to say like Jim Jordan who's investigating this is somehow a chilling speech you got to be kidding me when they censored truthful data the claim that the government has been censoring Americans is now being fought out in the courts a federal appeals court has ruled that the Biden Administration likely overstepped First Amendment Protections in one ongoing federal court case newly revealed Communications between the White House and social media companies have led to a ruling that the Biden Administration likely violated the first amendment in its efforts to Curel misinformation the issue may now be heading to the Supreme Court but the targets of musk's Twitter files say there are already far-reaching consequences social media is a battlefield and I think anybody who's going to war is going to try to skew the battlefield to their advantage one way to do that is to make companies too scared to do what Twitter did for years and I think every platform from now until the end of time is going to think about what it would mean to fact check one of Donald Trump's tweets perhaps we're past that point but for every hearing for every report for every news cycle platforms are going to hesitate just a little bit more before the next time they take some type of politically controversial action all of this work and all of this effort that so many people went and put into attempting to defend our democracies and defend our information ecosystems is very much starting to fall apart Twitter's Bluebird logo is no more El and it was replaced with a giant X by summer 2023 musk's long-term plans for X were finally coming into focus with the company losing money fast he made good on his promise to appoint a new CEO she is Linda Yaro who's just left a top position running ad sales at NBC Universal Elon focuses on product design and I'm responsible for the the rest running the company muskin Yak arino signaled an ambitious New Direction for x a so-called everything app for messaging calls social media posts entertainment payments and more I was joining the company to partner with Elon to transform Twitter into X the everything app she's a very high ranking ad executive probably the one of the top ones in the country maybe she will figure it out maybe they can make it into a big business she thinks she can make it a good home and an effective home for advertisers of course she knows as someone who bought Advertiser maybe it's not a good home for Advertiser well mus isn't a guy who's like failed all that many times I mean he's he's been wildly successful he sends Rockets into space he's got you know an incredible car company cars and Rockets are not media this is harder than rocket science it's not harder or less hard it's just different and just cuz you play basketball doesn't mean you're good at baseball the problem with a lot of these tech people is cuz they think they're good at one thing they're good at everything and that's just not the case okay okay let me let me see is this working go well let's just just make sure this things working first I really appre appreciate Elon coming down and giving an unfiltered uh uh depiction of what's happening on the border this is not like uh you know a piece that's being filmed and then subsequently edited and whatnot this is under musk X is becoming a home to what he calls citizen journalism and a platform for some of the most divisive voices hey it's Tucker Carlson we're told there are no Gatekeepers here if that turns out to be false we'll leave Tucker Carlson started a show on X after he was kicked off Fox News we'll get bigger ratings using this crazy Forum that you're using than probably the debate billionaires want to own media platforms I've never seen a billionaire own a media platform that so obviously is using it as a personal platform he has a megaphone for his perspectives he has used it to maliciously attack people via the quote Twitter files he has used it to spread actual misinformation and I worry about what then is happening behind the scenes and importantly what's going to happen in the next election not just in the US but also other countries around the world on the world stage it's becoming clear that musk's rhetoric about Free Speech does not necessarily extend to other countries Turkish government asked Twitter to censor its opponents right before an election and Elon Musk complied tonight Elon Musk Under Fire after Twitter appears to have censored links to a BBC documentary that's critical of the Indian Prime Minister narandra Modi you know Elon has said that he does not believe in free speech as a concept that goes beyond borders that each country has its own idea of free speech the best we can do um is really to uh uh Hue close to the law in any given country which if you don't want to get kicked out of certain Nations is certainly the business perspective to take Elon desperately wants to get Tesla into India so the fact that he has subjugated his desire for free speech in modi's India does not Shock me at all um I'm confident that that Tesla will in India and we'll do so as soon as uh humanly possible someone very smart said to me this is a guy with other business interests around the world especially space and Tesla and and Starling he needs influence around the world with autocrats and governments when he walks in a room as the head of Tesla okay just another like look Ford walks in it's the same thing he's on the same level but when he's also the owner of Twitter he gets a little more attention and it gives him political power you don't need any introduction you have been always proven right now there is almost not always there are some people who believe that you are genius and there there are some who are you believe that you are EV I am um definitely not evil so yeah hopefully not evil aspirationally not evil um so uh [Music] yeah SpaceX says all systems are go for its launch of the most powerful rocket ever into orbit almost

back and ignore it the entire Starship stack continu to rotate we should have had Separation by now obviously this is uh does not appear to be a Nal [Music] situation he's willing to shoot off rockets and let them blow up he's willing to fire engineers at Twitter and see if it survives and he feels that we've become a society filled with more referees than innovators filled with more lawyers than

why cuz he has the money the means and the creativity oh he is changing the social media platform we must protect Free Speech I've never seen a billionaire own a media platform that so obviously is using it as a personal platform and the implications for free speech since mus took over what would you say your main findings have been number one I would say harassment has increased the massive rebranding of Twitter Miss bading post about the ongoing Israeli Palestinian conflict this guy amazing success story who decided to go by Twitter cuz he cares so much about the First Amendment foreign disinformation do you agree that's a threat yeah no one appreciates that but the first amendment is the first amendment now on front line Elon Musk the world's richest man because I've done himself Elon Musk Elon Musk musk musk musk Elon Musk Elon Musk Elon musk's Twitter takeover he wants to shake things up and when things are calm he seeks out storms launch Auto sequence initiated AKA The Holy Mouse click for 345 liftoff # Falcon heavy launch countdown one SpaceX heavy go for launch 10 9 eight Side based oration six it had all the elements of a perfect day for Elon Musk to heavy a test launch of his latest reusable rocket the most powerful in the world capable of deep space [Applause] exploration it was a crucial step toward his ultimate goal the conquest of Mars Elon Musk I think gets his most pleasure out of rocket ships and at moments when the Rockets go off that's when the childish pleasure comes out t plus 302 if you can hear me over the cheering Falcon heavy heading to space on our test flight he doesn't usually like having pleasure he doesn't Savor the moment but he does when it's a rocket launch camera views from inside the payload fairing # Falcon heavy

outdone himself this time normally for a new rocket you know they launch like a block of concrete I mean that's so boring it's still tripping me out I mean I'm tripping Bulls here the electric car and the reusable rocket were part of a vast business Empire from neurotechnology to artificial intelligence to a web of satellites encircling the Earth that has made Elon Musk one of the richest and most powerful men in the world view from SpaceX launch control apparently there is a car in orbit around Earth and the app he was using to live tweet the launch a few years later that would be his too Elon Musk puts in an offer to buy Twitter Elon Musk and Twitter announced a $44 billion deal today from he says he wants to transform the company well I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech for the past 6 months we've been investigating Elon musk's controversial purchase of Twitter how it's expanded his influence into politics at a time of deep division Across America now we've got someone who's going to take over Twitter who actually believes in the Constitution and free speech and what it means for one of the world's most important platforms for news and political debate to be under the control of one man this is a human being that we're giving all of this power to and there are very few checks on that power right now this is the story of Elon musk's latest Mission and its far-reaching consequences a new name for Twitter Twitter owner Elon Musk has replaced the iconic bird logo with an X this came with almost no warning as he made the announcement that the platform will now be known as x.com today construction Crews blocked a lane on Market Street to take down the Twitter sign letter by letter passers by stopped clicked and shared on social media what was happening I don't know what the thought process is this is probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen I think it's thing over the span of just a few days in July 2023 Twitter disappeared and became X named after Elon musk's favorite letter you know what Elon Musk thinks he's Batman and I'm over it the former Twitter building now home to X and the giant X sign and the neighbors say the lights coming from that X sign are simply blinding it was the end of a brand that had grown grown into a global icon since its founding 17 years ago there is a new service and supposedly it is the next big thing it's a name you can't forget it's called Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter what is Twitter it's stupid and lame and small yet master blogger Robert scobble can't keep his fingertips off Twitter is rather addictive we're looking at my Twitter account and Twitter was founded in 2006 as a simple messaging platform where users posted about daily life users no longer need a PC or a Blog messaging can be typed by cell phone that's its selling point but it quickly evolved into what became known as the global Town Square what made you want to get up and do something Twitter it felt like it was where the conversation was happening if there was a news story that dropped on the New York Times it was debated on Twitter if a journalist like me felt like their story was going viral it was going viral on Twitter you sent me a tweet the queen started tweeting the Pop's first tweet it had famous people across Sports media politics John obviously needs to work on his typing skills and just like generally funny people who were good at Twitter and the kind of combination of all of those things felt like it was where the conversation was happening I just typed something in to my iPhone and boom it's in their brains musk joined the conversation in 2010 please ignore prior tweets as that was someone pretending to be me this is actually me at the time the South African born entrepreneur was already rich and had a reputation for taking risks he'd used the fortune he made as a founder of PayPal to start a rocket company and to buy a stake in Tesla a fledgeling electric car company that under his leadership would revolutionize the industry and earn musk praise as a Pioneer in the fight against climate change on Twitter he started sharing books he liked and random observations about the world compared to past today's world is fantastic I like donon I like I thought he was quirky and interesting and creative you could warm Mars up over time with greenhouse gases and kind of the opposite of what we're doing on Earth yeah this is great I was in great admiration because most people in Silicon Valley are talking about stupid things or making dating apps he was doing significant stuff thanks for having me it's great to see you guys thank you for coming I really appreciate it you kept your promise which was nice Cara swisser writes about Silicon Valley and has known musk for more than 20 years talk she's interviewed him multiple times you started covering musk I mean even before PayPal right yes there was a million startup people like him in Silicon Valley but I remember him and what what were your impressions of him then I paid pretty good attention to him but not a lot particularly but then when he started doing the stuff around SpaceX and bought Tesla from the actual Founders that was interesting because he was different the real big breakthrough that's needed with r street is a truly reusable run how do you split your time between car and Rocket well it's usually about 50/50 he was a smart person doing big things and so there weren't there literally can't think of someone who was doing as big things as he was what's going on with you and Twitter some people some people use their hair to express themselves I use Twitter but there was another side to musk that swisser came to know over the years he's such a quirky personality and an unusual sense of humor that um much more juvenile than the other boys they're all boys but you know it was even more so a lot of fart jokes or uh penis jokes and you know whatever I you know he liked those he thought they were hysterical I'm reading Robert massie's book on Catherine the Great yeah I know what you're probably thinking did she really a horse for musk Twitter was the perfect Outlet twit has always been a place where you can be very honest there were a lot of sassy comments a lot of wit and yeah a lot of things that riled people up that was literally what Twitter was for Twitter was the Free Speech wing of the Free Speech party and didn't have any rules that was very much the approach when these companies were starting I love [Music] Twitter Elon Musk is more impetuous more impulsive more addicted to things than anybody I've ever seen that's what drives him when he gets riled up he either tweets or plays video games musk wouldn't talk to Frontline but biographer Walter Isaacson spent the past two years shadowing him you as a kid he was bullied on the playground and he was a scraw kid so he kept getting beaten up they push him down the concrete steps and bloody his face some of the bullies and those scars have always been with him whenever he gets into a dark place he remembers that playground and he goes dark and in some ways Twitter is the ultimate Global playground except for the scrawny kids and the smart kids get followers they don't get smashed into the concrete steps you use your tweeting to to kind of get back at critics you kind of have little Wars with the Press Twitter is a war zone if somebody's going to jump in the war zone it's like okay you're in the arena let's go musk's natural affinity for Twitter earned him millions of followers then tens of millions Elon Musk was insanely popular on Twitter he'd always had a ton of followers but he was inching up to being the most followed person on Twitter and it felt like everything he touched turned to gold in terms of follower count so if he interacted with someone suddenly that person's follower count shot up it just felt like there was so much engagement and interest in everything he did Elon had evangelists he attracted a kind of very online mostly male following that wants technology to save the world it was very clear to me that his followers had this kind of Brotherly sense or my cool older brother my cool Uncle my cool dad who is trying to fix the world for me Tesla shares surging following CEO Elon Musk cryptic tweets saying it's added a lot of value to his you know wealth and to the value of his companies well sharers of paloalto based Tesla jumped more than 2% following this mysterious teasing message from CEO Alon musk he wrote It's like enabled Tesla to raise money it's increased the size of his fortune and uh that's from Twitter yeah this is Mark yeah Tesla says we don't really spend on advertising and marketing because Elon Musk is on Twitter it was a similar approach to another businessman who' mastered the art of Twitter I have a big voice I have you know millions and millions of followers on Twitter and when I say something people some people don't like it but most people do like it Donald Trump used Twitter for years to pump himself his businesses his show and it was how he got this massive following what a and Elon used Twitter the same exact way there's very little difference similar Playbook similar Playbook you know if I tweet something CNN and fox all of a sudden they say we have breaking news Donald Trump has just made it I'm sitting there tweeting big big Donald Trump's use of Twitter to circumvent the media first as a candidate then as president elevated Twitter to the most influential political platform in America president Trump tweeted to announce his firing of his Secretary of Veterans Affairs president Trump tweeting out policy on gun safety in our nation's schools president Trump tweeting moments ago Rex Tillerson out as Secretary of State Twitter skyrocketed to a level of prominence that I don't think its Founders really expected is there an effort within the White House to try to rein in the president's Twitter habit it also took on this Central role in Democratic deliberation that I don't think anybody could have expected a single Tech platform to do but for most of this time musk had steered clear of political controversy on Twitter to be clear I'm not a conservative am registered independent and politically moderate I never knew elon's politics like they were all over the place he voted for Obama he was a big Obama supporter I remember he liked Obama better than I did you never knew where he was going to come down politically you didn't like I didn't ever feel he had any big Point of View California is now under a Statewide stay-at-home order the first the pandemic would spark a shift in musk that like so much in his life would play out on Twitter the Corona virus Panic is dumb I think Elon musk's tweets are a lot more fun when stocks go up and it's a bull market when it's more serious like this it feels a little like you know not the time not now Elon he had a point of view about that the the virus was not dangerous and that might have been but at the time people did not know and it could have gone a lot of different ways and a million people died at one point he was like I read everything and I now know and I'm like thank you Dr musk and I was like you don't know anything it's like ridiculous well they're wrong about the mask wearing or they're wrong about the don't touch thing I said well they didn't know now they know it's called science California's 40 million residents are in lockdown at the time the government had ordered musk to close his Tesla factories in California I mean he was pissed that his factories were were kind of forced to close ultimately yes that's the thing he wanted them there and he wanted them working he thought it was the it was an existential crisis if Tesla didn't succeed he really that for the world for all of us and then it got weird free America now people their freedom hit in California have been half empty this whole time now people back their freedom musk told his employees that he intended to defy orders and go to work Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla is defying stay-at-home orders daring authorities to arrest him by reopening his California Factory CEO Elon Musk tweeted I will be on the line with everyone else if anyone is arrested I ask that it only be me musk AED his frustrations on a Tesla earnings call frankly I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights what the excuse me this is fascist this is not Democratic this is not Freedom give people put back their damn Freedom musk's rhetoric on Co would win him an unexpected Ally and president Trump who tweeted California should let Tesla and Elon Musk open the plant now musk tweeted back thank you when you say civilization's fragile do you mean because of this coid 19 that's going on right now what's that I never heard of it this this thing he also found a sympathetic ear with Joe Rogan the most popular podcaster in the country gener I think that's like we we should be concerned about um anything that's a massive infringement on our civil Li civil liberties yes yeah my my opinion is if if if somebody wants to stay home they should stay home and if say somebody doesn't want to stay home they should not be compelled to stay home in May a cryptic tweet from musk signaled his shifting politics when he tweets take the red pill a line from The Matrix it means question this ideology that may have been imposed try to find out out the real truth all I'm offering is the truth nothing more but it was mostly a signal that he had joined that I'd call it the somewhat conspiratorial uh people on the right who feel that the media and the establishment are imposing a narrative on us today as protests erupted across the country many Governors say it's still too soon to lift restrictions musk's position on the pandemic aligned him with the growing chorus of conservatives who felt their personal Liberty was under attack from all sides this our First Amendment right the government the scientific establishment the press and increasingly social media he was also noticing that on Twitter if you said that lockdowns could cause more harm than good you'd be kind of repressed on Twitter so this made them upset they're saying to us if you dare go against what we say is true not necessarily what is true but what we say is true then we're going to boot you it's true that social media companies had become more proactive about what was on their sites I'd call this here into order and I'd like to welcome our Witnesses today Jack dorsy chief executive officer at Twitter for years before the pandemic Twitter's CEO and founder Jack dorsy had been criticized in the press and lamb based in Congress for his company's failure to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation especially after Russian interference in the 2016 election we're now removing over 200% more accounts for violating our policies we were tasked with making sure our algorithms were responding in a way that was actually beneficial to humanity not driving misinformation not driving bias and discrimination Raman chowy a data scientist ran a team of Engineers at Twitter tasked with ensuring the platform's algorithms did not promote harmful content there are millions of tweets any given second that you could see on your timeline your little iPhone screen only shows maybe three of those at a time so we have to build multiple systems that are identifying what you'd want to see it I mean it shapes the universe of what people are seeing absolutely it shapes the universe of perception it is telling us what is important and what is not important so my team's job was to ensure that the algorithms that we're building were responding to some of the issues that governments were talking about people were talking about and this increasing fear of how social media might be changing the course of Elections how it might be you know um making children's Minds rot how it might be polarizing young men and causing some of the violence that we're seeing in the world how it might be spreading lies more than truth absolutely that's definitely a concern in late 2019 Twitter fielded a large scale study of users of the service and asked them do you think Twitter should take some type of action on misinformation and what we heard back from a majority of users globally was yes yel raw started at Twitter in 2015 while finishing his PhD in Communications he would work his way up to run in the content moderation team a job that would ultimately lead him to clash with Elon Musk Twitter's users told us that when it came to certain types of harmful misinformation they didn't think it was acceptable for the company to do nothing they wanted us to step in and so that's what we did that seems like a particularly messy business for a social media a company like Twitter how did you think about your role as sort of an Arbiter of Truth misinformation was one of the hardest policy issues for Twitter to take on for many years our position was we are not the Arbiters of truth but we also saw that some types of misinformation if left completely unchecked could be incredibly dangerous and damaging and so we had to figure out when and where it might be appropriate to step in but it does put you at Twitter in the uncomfortable position position of having to kind of determine something as misinformation determine something as being a lie I don't think it's a comfortable position for companies to be in to have to arbitrate whether something is true or false but there's still a responsibility that goes along with being the place where these conversations happen we see that when platforms are hands off with dangerous speech that dangerous things happen as a result so as misinformation about the Corona virus continues to spread glob Twitter has implemented a new system to sort of highlight bogus or unverified claims so when you are in a very Public Health crisis and health emergency and individuals are looking for information that can literally be life-saving to have misinformation spreading could be the difference between life and death Anika Coler navaroli a lawyer and Senior member of the Twitter safety team helped write the company's content moderation policies in May 2020 Twitter rolled out a new system of labeling tweets deemed to be misinformation many experts called the steady stream of false information and conspiracy theories and infodemic so there was this new Intervention which was this label and I think it really did sort of change the experience and change the conversation for a lot of people because it felt like social media companies were intervening in things that they never had done before which they were speech police never met him why is it funny I you know I think it's I think it's funny to me because people have used a lot of words and a lot of phrases to kind of describe the job that I did right we were known as Twitter Gods we were known as Twitter jail and the thought police the speech police you know all of these various terms I think have been used towards you know humans who were showing up every day just trying to do our jobs what would be a better description then of what you did content moderation Twitter's new approach would play into concerns that social media companies had started to constrain what people could say about the pandemic and the response they want unquestioned obedience so they're cracking down on free expression in late April Elon Musk tweeted Silicon Valley has become sanctimonious Valley too much the moral Arbiter of the world today Governor Gavin Nome issued an executive order to send every one of Twitter's first misinformation labels would be the most fateful we are reaching out uh to all registered eligible voters and giving when California governor Gavin Newsome announced that he'd send millions of mail and ballots to voters in lockdown president Trump took to Twitter alleging this would lead to electoral fraud so in that moment we had to decide what to do we had built a new product and a new set of Technologies for labeling misinformation and here was one of the most prominent accounts on the service spreading misinformation about voting by mail and so we made the decision to use our new labeling technology on one of Donald Trump's tweets for the first time how did it feel to make that decision it was a bit like a dam breaking for years Twitter had been criticized for not doing anything to address harmful speech from Donald Trump and in truth he had kind of paralyzed the company's content moderation efforts because we didn't know what the right answer was the company was holding back it was nervous about taking its first action to moderate a sitting head of state and then we did it and the response was immediate let's bring kellyanne Conway counselor to the president the day after we labeled Donald Trump's post for the first time I woke up to Kelly and Conway on Fox News I want to raise the the name of somebody at Twitter he's the head of integrity and his name is yoel Roth he's y y o e l somebody in San Francisco go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers this I was floored I had never gotten that level of public attention before his name is yel Roth and he's the next day I was on the cover of the New York Post along with several of my old tweets the president held an oval office press conference to crying social media censorship he called me a hater if Twitter were not honorable if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think just shut it down as far as I'm concerned but I'd have to go through a legal process to do how you down I became the poster child for Silicon Valley bias and censorship Twitter's head of sight Integrity has tweeted that there are quote actual Nazis in the White House the Trump Administration pointed to tweets Roth had posted back in 2016 not long after he joined Twitter accusing him of bias this is just incredible I'm just saying we fly over those states that voted for a racist Tangerine for a reason it's obviously not decency and it's sure as hell not neutrality or objectivity what were you thinking tweeting those things I regret those tweets but do they not reveal a liberal bias I mean that's what the president was saying they reveal a liberal bias my personal opinions didn't imp Twitter's policies Twitter's policies were the product of dozens of people working on them and were subject to approval not just by me but by a team of Executives and ultimately by the company's CEO Jack dorsy I take the responsibility that goes with my job seriously I wouldn't post those things today I would recommend against others in my line of work doing so but I think taking years old posts out out of context and suggesting that they represent some type of systematic bias is a misrepresentation of the fact isn't it a legitimate question though to ask in certain circumstances whether the referee is biased I mean at Twitter the vast majority of the staff I believe lean Democratic right so isn't it a legitimate question to ask if the ref is biased I think it's a legitimate question to ask there's also no evidence that it's true now there are new Gatekeepers and more Gatekeepers than ever they're authoritarians if they're willing to censor the president they will think nothing at all of silencing you and they don't Elon Musk would Echo the concerns Silicon Valley with the San Francisco Bay area has too much influence on the world in my opinion and I say that as someone who has spent most of his life in California mostly in the Bay Area you know there's some out there who just want to shut down one side of debate or another I I think we should resist that in October 2020 concerns about bias at at Twitter would only intensify when it made an unprecedented move temporarily blocking a New York Post news story about Hunter Biden's laptop in the runup to the presidential election these oligarchs in big Tech are treating us as if we are thiefs in their authoritarian regime the Twitter had locked out a story about Hunter Biden's laptop you know they kept it from being transmitted for about a day then they locked the New York Post out of their account for two weeks it was kind of a historic moment in American censorship Matt taibi then a reporter for Rolling Stone was alarmed by the development these companies Facebook Twitter uh google/youtube they are de facto monopolies in terms of distribution they control overwhelmingly who gets to see what once you start going down that road the whole history of any sort of unfree Society in the world is that once you take a step in that direction you know it never stops it it always keeps going the Trump campaign is accusing Twitter and Facebook of censorship after the social Twitter had blocked the story due to concerns that the laptop was part of a Russian Hack and leak operation intended to disrupt the American elections it wasn't Twitter's CEO also said Twitter should have communicated better about Twitter and dorsy soon admitted that blocking the New York Post story was a mistake musk agreed suspending the Twitter account of a major news Organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate Joseph R Biden Jr is elected the 46th president of the United States winning three weeks later president Trump lost the election and Twitter continued to slap labels on his tweets and many others that spread lies about the results this morning president Trump plans to speak to thousands of his supporters between election day and January Twitter labeled more than 140 separate tweets from the president every time I put out a tweet that's even if it's totally correct totally correct I get a flag we labeled them as misinformation we restricted them we fact checked them and the president kept posting them every day the same thing the same content the same lies I am very concerned about what happens tomorrow especially given what we have been seeing on the platform for the last several months um on January 5th in a video obtained by Frontline of an internal Twitter conference call Ana navaroli warned that Trump's tweets could lead to violence and we're still confused as to when we are actually going to be able to either trigger again like a crisis or an emergency like does somebody need to be murdered for months she'd been urging top Executives to change Tac to not just label some of Trump's tweets but take them down what I was advocating before January 6th was not for the permanent suspension or permanent Banning of any one account but rather the taking down of individual content and I remember you know sending a message to a larger team and saying this was like December of 2020 um saying out loud you know if there were any other country in the world in which the leader of the elected party was contesting a open and fair election and their followers were openly calling for civil war would we do anything differently because I firmly believed given you know the other circumstances that I had worked and I had seen that we would and yet we were not acting in this specific case so your warnings basically were unheeded yes did you get a sense that part of the reluct to do anything much about Trump's tweeting before January 6 was because he was a star of Twitter very much so he was the main attraction I believe that the Twitter platform was used to incite violence on January 6th and Twitter knew about it I specifically warned them yes and nothing was done nothing was done navaroli would eventually resign Twitter's founder Jack dorsy didn't respond to our request for an interview the company has said that it had a policy of giving heads of state more latitude and that nai's account leaves out the unprecedented steps it took to respond to threats during the 2020 [Applause] election as the events unfolded on January 6th at the capital [Music] building Twitter temporarily suspended the president a 12-hour timeout but 2 Days Later Trump was at it again the president returned to Twitter and posted that he would not be attending President Biden's inauguration he posted that the American Patriots who had supported him would have a voice long into the future and that tweet lit a use and we saw that the president's rhetoric about Patriots having a voice into the future was being seen as a call to action as a promise that the president would have people's back as they protested demonstrated and even carried out acts of violence you were interpreting it as a call to arms but was it literally you know a call to Arms I want to emphasize that wasn't my interpretation that was how people received the president's statements whatever the president's intentions and we can't get in his head we don't know what he was thinking whatever his intentions the result was that lots of people interpreted it as a call to action and a call to violence and it was not possible for the company to avoid taking action any longer I got to be honest like who elected you to take away the megaphone I mean who are you to make that choice I'm no one mhm and it wasn't my decision it was my recommendation there were other people who were involved in it who reviewed it who weighed in on it but ultimately it shouldn't be any one person's decision it's a terrifying amount of power for a company to have for any one person to have whether it's me Jack dorsy Elon Musk no one should have that kind of power and yet that power exists and somebody has to make a call whether in incitement of violence from a head of state crosses the line and I didn't seek out that power I don't think anyone working at Twitter or Facebook or any other platform did but when the power finds you and when the risks are so significant there's no choice but to act this morning president Trump waking up without his favorite megaphone Twitter has announced it is cutting off president Trump's ability to post on the social media site permanently I think that big Tech is doing a horrible thing for our country the suspension of President Trump was widely criticized including by Elon Musk a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast High Tech as the DEA facto Arbiter of free speech joining us remotely Elon Musk he'd call Twitter's decision a grave mistake I do think that it was not correct to ban Donald Trump it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice I think proma bands just fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter as a Town Square uh where um everyone can uh voice their opinion musk saw Twitter's decision not as an isolated incident but part of a larger Trend in American culture I think he felt that the educational establishment the med media the people who ran Twitter had sort of fallen into a group think and he felt they were suppressing people who were outside of the mainstream especially people on the right he called it the woke mind virus he basically meant the progressive very anti- capitalistic or anti- business feelings as well as the political correctness he felt where you had to use the right pronouns and other things an episode in musk's complicated family life would intensify his feelings about Progressive politics model by 2022 he'd had 11 children with three different women that spring one of his teenagers came out publicly as transgender and he got his mind around that okay but she became very left-wing and Progressive and Marxist rejected him for being a billionaire and Chang your last name and he kept saying that's the most hurtful thing that ever happened and that too I think pushed him because he felt that the woke ideology had infected her and others and so he becomes more anti-establishment more anti-woke Elon Musk right he would later explain his disdain for woke politics to comedian and talk show host Bill Mah I mean you have talked about this woke mind virus yes it's often anti bureaucratic at you can't you can't question things even the questioning is bad almost Anonymous would we would we cancel culture okay so this I I really can't emphasize this enough we must uh uh we must protect free speech um and Free Speech only matters it's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something you don't like because obviously speech that you like is you know that's easy um so it it's uh and it's the thing about censorship is that sure for those who would advocated um just remember at some point that will be turned on you musk's tough talk about the woke mind virus and his new found free speech Crusade would help make him one of the most popular figures in America he talks about this woke mindset virus and I think he's right it is a virus he's not afraid to speak the truth he's speaking the truth very boldly he was tapping into a growing concern in much of the country that Progressive ideas and policies had gone too far at its heart wokeness is divisive um exclusionary um and hateful on Sunday evening we got a a um notice hi The Babylon B your account has been locked for violating the Twitter rules for musk the last straw was in March 2022 when Twitter suspended one of his favorite accounts The Babylon b a right-wing satirical website and our offending tweet was the Babylon be's man of the year is Rachel Lavine and you thought was was a nice honor the Babylon B had mocked the nation's highest ranking transgender official Admiral Rachel LaVine by awarding her the title Man of the Year a violation of Twitter's misgendering policy at the time Elon Musk took issue with the the Banning of uh The Babylon B you know they were taken off because they I guess misgendered um one of Biden's uh appointees a you know a transo point and I could see why people would think that's offensive but we've protected comedy in this country for a long time even when it's incredibly offensive uh precisely because you know that's where a lot of social change happens if you start making it banable to to say the wrong thing you're you're going to not have comedy soon you know it's just a joke and and and they're they're asking us to basically bend the knee and say we admit that this is hateful conduct please keep on your platform and we're not going to do that and so in the case of the Babylon B they posted content that misgendered Admiral Rachel LaVine they claimed it was satire but they did it fully recognizing that they had violated Twitter's rules you don't get to join somebody else's community and decide that you're going to set your own rules can you explain why is there a policy about misgendering if somebody expresses a preference to have somebody use one set of pronouns and somebody willfully uses another that's an attempt to silence them it's an attempt to intimidate them to abuse them to harass them and that conduct ultimately makes people less comfortable speaking publicly on a platform like Twitter which I view as counterproductive you can make that decision when you're a company and there's lots of reasons for it you do it because it attracts users you do it because it attracts advertisers you do it because certain identity categories are actually protected under the law in the United States and elsewhere and you have an obligation to do it but those are decisions that you make as a company you are curating a community and you get to decide whether some types of harmful and hateful conduct are outside of the bounds of what's okay when Babylon B was suspended musk's ex-wife texted him a suggestion can you buy Twitter and then delete it please XX America is going insane please do something to fight woke is M I will do anything to help XX musk tested the waters on Twitter given that Twitter serves as the deao Public Town Square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done at the beginning of 2022 things are going really well for him he had a lot of money burning a hole in his pocket cuz he had exercised some stock options but when things go well for musk he gets unsettled sometimes he wants to shake things up he's been as his brother Kimble says a drama addict his whole life and when things are calm he seeks out storms by March musk had been quietly buying Twitter stock hoping to push the company in a New Direction he told me this could fulfill my vision of x.com which was the company had started 20 years earlier that morphed into PayPal but he had wanted it to be larger than a PayPal he wanted it to be a social network a payments platform a place place where everybody could create content and get paid for it he wanted to transform content the way Steve Jobs transformed the music business Twitter offered him a seat on the board in texts with perog Agarwal Jack dorsey's new CEO musk seemed eager to help I have a ton of ideas but let me know if I'm pushing too hard I just want Twitter to be maximum amazing in the midst of the turmoil of him buying stock and being offered a board seat on Twitter he flies off to Hawaii doesn't usually take vacations but this is three or 4 days at Larry Ellison's house and he's meeting a girl he was seeing at the time Natasha Basset an Australian actress but instead of relishing the vacation he stays up all night tweeting and texting most of these top accounts tweet rarely and post very little content is Twitter dying it was the day musk was is set to join the board Agarwal texted him you are free to tweet is Twitter dying or anything else about Twitter but it's my responsibility to tell you that it's not helping me make Twitter better in the current context musk snapped back what did you get done this week less than a minute later I'm not joining the board this is a waste of time 15 seconds after that we'll make an offer to take Twitter private elon's impatience and impulsiveness just drove him to say I don't want a board seat I want to control this musk made his offer $43 billion all cash take it or leave it he tweeted the news about an hour ago simply saying quote I made an offer Elon Musk wants Twitter but he doesn't got it yet this is not only a big wi for free speech it is about a big ship that's coming he says he wants to transform the company Caris swisser was initially optimistic I thought it was a great idea I thought he'd be a good owner why um because he has the money the means and the creativity to do something I thought he um I thought he could get stuff done and he actually asked me my ideas because I knew a lot about Twitter I was a very heavy user I was working with Twitter on a bunch of things that were were interesting to make money and I was very clear like you can do it you can make this into much better business and he said let's get together and talk about it yeah so we heard musk this afternoon say he's not sure that this will succeed not all of his friends and family were so enthusiastic in early April he's at the factory in Texas for Tesla and his brother is arguing don't get into Twitter you got enough else to do even his kids at dinner are saying why are you doing this his kids say we don't use Twitter I just sat and watched as all these arguments were going on but I did ask him how does it fit in to all your other missions and he said well it doesn't really fit in but maybe by helping democracy it'll help civilization survive I think he always has to put these things in some huge large epic framework and he eventually convinced himself of that my biological neuronet concluded that if putter was not bought and steered in a good direction that it would be a danger for the future of civilization he is somebody ever since he was reading comic books as a kid who needs to see himself on an epic [Applause] mission after Twitter accepted his offer musk appeared celebratory at the Met Galla with his mother I told him not to Take On The World and the universe and he didn't listen aspirationally I am trying to do good for uh humanity and and the future of civilization throughout all of this I really thought he has bought some Twitter stock he's talked about buying Twitter what are the odds that he will actually get his act together there's a gap between like Elon Musk tweeting I'm going to buy this company or like sending a angry text message saying I want to buy your company and like the bankers at Morgan Stanley putting together the commitment letter saying here's your $44 billion of financing did it appear like an Impulse buy I would have said more like a rage by it didn't on the surface seem to have a ton of like lot like business or Financial logic to it one reason it seems impulsive is cuz he changed his mind like a week later you know like he tried to get out of the deal Elon Musk now backing out of his $44 billion agreement to purchase Twitter the social media giant suing him for $44 billion in an effort to enforce their original merger agreement Does Elon Musk have any legal footing here maybe I think that probably what was happening there was mostly that he realized he was overpaying no one really knows but I think that probably what he was looking to do was recut the deal at a lower price probably musk hinting of a new era of Twitter earlier this week after several months of legal wrangling musk gave up agreeing to the terms of his original offer Deon musk is in control of Twitter this morning the world's richest man closed his Blockbuster deal overnight to take now that it's no longer a publicly traded company he'll have no shareholders to answer to which means he can run the company how he wants on October 26th 2022 Elon Musk arrived at Twitter headquarters with a gag in hand I was standing in the lobby with parag goal and some of the leaders of Twitter they were waiting for mus to come in and then he comes in with that sink entering Twitter HQ let that sink in you could feel a certain tension in the air because Twitter is this caring comforting environment with all sorts of quiet rooms and yoga studios and mental health days and they believe in psychological safety and must turn to me and said psychological safety and he sort of laughs he says that's the enemy of innovation I believe in hardcore intensity musk had taken on more than 12 billion in debt and needed to start making Cuts quickly he'd brought with him a team of friends relatives and Loyalists from his other companies to help them do just that suddenly an army of people materialized in the office who didn't have Twitter name tags or Twitter computers and who started telling Twitter staff what to do and the Assumption was that they had some kind of authority because Elon had brought them over they knew how to build cars they knew how to launch rockets they knew how to dig tunnels but they didn't necessarily know about how to run a social media company teams were asked originally to print out out code I think 50 pages of code and have it reviewed by a Tesla engineer people were standing at the printer printing out their code and sort of standing in line like a bunch of students about to be reprimanded by a dean and that whole exercise is not valuable Engineers who build cars do not understand the code behind social media systems they're they're totally different things that was just a performance of loyalty within days ran was part of the first round of layoffs everyone's rolling okay we spoke to a group of former employees some of whom told us they'd been initially excited by the prospect of musk taking over I was what I would initially call team hype um when he was first offered to buy the company and then in early June we had an all hands with him Elon thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me glad to be able to speak to everyone a leaked video of the meeting was posted online I like okay I'm going to see the business version of el monks not the weird Twitter guy right and we're going to hear like facts about his product vision and we're going to hear a bunch of stuff around that he showed up late to that meeting he showed up in a very unprofessional manner made joke already but uh you know some people use their hair to express themselves I use Twitter um the meeting was very Meandering it was very light on details that some of my some of my comments about Twitter being sort of like a digital Town Square um but really much more than that it was going into AI he talked about extending the light of Consciousness and start to get like Mars colonization we should take the set of actions most likely to uh extend the scope scale and lifespan of Consciousness as we know it um and uh can't believe that's the transition from Aliens away away from this conversation back to uh to Twitter what I guess I didn't quite hear at that meeting what I thought what I would see a very professional kind of visionary or industrialist I just saw the same Twitter guy Elon Musk making major moves after his takeover at Twitter telling employees layoffs will begin later this morning a week after musk's takeover the entire Twitter staff received an email 5 5:30 on Thursday which is 8:00 people have left for the day on the East Coast Central Time this note about oh here Way's going to happen you'll get an email either to your work email or your personal email I remember over text with half my team and we were literally refreshing like we were logging into our computers I'm on the East Coast I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. that night like just kind of checking like do I still have access and then at 3:00 a.m. I was like you know what I'll find out in the morning if I'm still an employee I was having dinner with my family and I'm on the East Coast um and my phone was just dinging uh during the dinner I opened my computer and when I logged in I lost access like everything shut off the screen went gray at that moment and I literally started crying in front of my kids it could have been handled a whole lot better should have been handled a whole lot better and with more humanity and so shame on him for that I spent over an an hour and a half I don't know why I'm so emotional I thought I'm over this so I lied on in bed and and I scroll to the top of the of the timeline and I looked at everybody's message I scrolled over about 9 hours worth of saluting emojis and the next day is like you went through a fire and you're looking for survivors this morning thousands of Twitter employees are out of a job there'd be more rounds of layoffs and firings over the coming months it felt like I was on a sinking ship they had just let like 75% of the people on the ship drown and I'm still here on this ship and I'm like don't know what I'm doing oh and how how many of you even by a show of hands are still waiting on a proper Severance what you were promised really all of you thousands of former workers have sued Twitter raising claims including unpaid Severance and bonuses Twitter contends its ex-employees have received everything they owed Twitter customers support At Your [Laughter] Service musk defended the layoffs on the Silicon Valley podcast Allin on balance how did you get to your intuition on what the efficient Frontier of employees needed to be to make the product better well um yeah I I I observed part of this where you basically ask the question who here is critical and who here is exception yes I mean so I mean really the what the criteria trying to apply and obviously you're not going to be perfect um if you're moving fast and and there's a lot of you know people you're talking about here is that anyone who is exceptional at what they do where the role is critical and they have a positive effect uh on others um and they are trusted meaning they put the company's interests before their own uh should stay pretty straightforward yeah and and you know also and also is up for working you know working hard like uh that would not that would not these that's not was not Twitter's prior culture the first time that I met Elon Musk was a few hours after he fired my boss I assumed that I was going to be fired and was frankly surprised that it was happening in person but a member of elon's Team requested to meet with me so the initial perspective that somebody on his team had was well turn off all access to content moderation tools just stop all of it nobody moderates anything really and I explained that that wouldn't be a viable approach because there's lots of types of moderation that are simply non-negotiable around combating terrorism around protecting children I suggested that we not shut down those lines of work and he agreed and I was just floored there was a moment that i' had been expecting not just to be fired but to be walked out the door immediately and instead I was making a recommendation to Elon Musk about content moderation he agreed with me and he understood what we were trying to do and I thought for a minute maybe it won't be as bad as we've been assuming maybe it's all just for show hate speech is surging on Twitter following Elon musk's takeover despite musk would soon be tested he put up the bat signal to racist to misogynists to homophobes groups that monitor hate speech like the Anti-Defamation League spotted a worrying Trend we saw this surge of toxic trolling and hate speech that just blew up on the platform days after the company was bought there was a trolling campaign that was supposedly testing the waters of the new Twitter the idea was that trolls should come to the platform and post racist content as proof that Elon was now allowing racism in a way that the previous administration didn't and so there was a surge in racism a coalition of groups including the ADL called on big advertisers to pause spending on Twitter this growing list of companies pressing pause on their Twitter ads Audi's leaving uh GM is leaving fer is leaving we wanted clarification on how the company was thinking about its policies around addressing hate and harassment on its service the tactic of working with advertisers and pressuring advertisers is essentially a tactic of like let's hit them where it hurts I mean advertising is their main Revenue stream like Proctor and Gamble and Unilever and craft and cocacola and McDonald's and Starbucks I mean these businesses invest billions of billions of dollars in their brands they spend countless amounts of money to try to connect with consumers and all we want to do is make sure they understand that their brands are being you know flighted up on these sites next to I don't know swas stickers or next to white supremacist content or next to other hateful content and then look if McDonald's thinks or cocacola thinks that they want their ads up against you know horrible racist content they can they can do that the day Elon officially took over the use of the nword on Twitter shot up 500% and so there's this question of whether or not trolls or or or different people are testing the limits of what is appropriate on Twitter and I think it tells you all you need to know about how musk's messaging and his signaling has been received how as hate speech continued to Surge musk called in yoel Roth who is now leading Twitter's trust and Safety Division my directions from Elon directly were shut it down get rid of all of it he actually even wanted us to go further than we had previously and said it's not just about targeted hateful conduct attacks on somebody he's like just take all of this stuff down get rid of the slurs get rid of all of it and he pushed us to take a more aggressive position shutting down free speech he was doing it out of a recognition that advertisers objected to this content and we're judging him and the new Twitter by our ability to effectively moderate it but as advertisers continued to stay away and revenue plummeted musk suddenly changed course and began pushing back Twitter has had a massive drop in Revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists extremely messed up they're trying to destroy free speech in America inside Twitter he asked Roth and his team to block posts supporting the advertising pause one of the things that was very hypocritical in my view is that you had people urging boycotts because they thought Twitter was allowing too much hate speech and must decided he wanted to shut down some of these people who are advocating a boycott well that goes against Free Speech principles that's pure political speech and yoel Roth and other people there said you can't do that I was spending more and more of my time each day dealing with impulsive and erratic questions and decisions and feeling that I was becoming less and less effective in pushing back on them I would get questions about conspiracy theories about Twitter's moderation and would have to spend hours answering them I managed to push back on some of elon's requests to ban users outside of our policies but I was sort of left wondering at what point does that not work anymore at what point does he not listen to me at what point do I get fired for this and I realized that pushing back on individual bad decisions wasn't going to be enough and so I quit is this working Hey guys you're on too welcome this is me curling a 45 oh my gosh with yel Roth gone along with much of the trust and safety team musk was remaking Twitter in his own image here we are uh at the at the merch thing and there's an entire closet full of hash woke in late November he announced a general amnesty for many accounts Twitter had previously suspended and reinstated The Babylon B former president Donald Trump and Neo-Nazi Andrew angan he basically turned back on a lot of people people who' previously been banned from the platform the kind of Bad actors who were using Twitter to abuse people to bully people to intimidate people again to propagate antisemitism and anti-black racism and fairly awful stuff musk defended the amnesty stating that the company was using its algorithms to ensure that even if hateful content was posted on Twitter that content would not get seen by many users there's more of an allowance for what you what some might call hate speech on the system but it's just it's not going to be promoted it's not like we're not going to be recommending hate speech just at risk of stating the obvious he argued that the critical thing to tackle was hate speech Impressions the number of times a tweet actually shows up on someone's timeline or search results you're you're doing a lot more to take down hate speech than the company was doing yeah absolutely hb's impressions are down by a third and will get even um lower but this claim was almost impossible to verify I think there was a moment shortly after I left Twitter when the company said that every week they would put out new data about the prevalence of hate speech to the contrary Twitter is actually cut back on the level of data available to researchers who want to study the platform Twitter went from being one of the most transparent companies to to one of the least the Twitter verse exploding over that controversial tweet posted part of Twitter's problem was musk himself he deleted that tweet but not before got more than a 100,000 likes and his tweets at times became dark and conspiratorial just 48 hours after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi in San Francisco Elon Musk Twitter's new CEO tweeted out a conspiracy theory about the attack there's a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye the article questions Mr Pelosi's sexuality even suggesting he may have known his attacker San Francisco was so homophobic it was crazy here's the owner of Twitter retweeting misinformation about an attack on a man in in an anti-gay way I I was like who does this and then it got just weird and mean like constant attacks constant retweeting misinformation then he started doing transphobic stuff he's got a kid who's trans that was like shocking and so it just went on and on and on and on and it was like what in the world happened to you musk deleted the post about Paul Pelosi and would later apologize but the controversial tweets kept coming he would stay up late drink Red Bull take ambient sometimes he would get into this dark demon mode and that's when the very paranoid or conspiratorial tweets came out one day he was traveling with a friend Antonio gracius and musk had kept tweeting late at night doing these ridiculous tweets sometimes very harmful ones and so the friend said let me take your phone and I'm going to put it in the safe here in the hotel room friend punches in the code he said that way you can't use it late at night at 3: in the morning musk calls hotel security to get him to open the safe and he starts doing tweets he was addicted to tweeting late one night in the workroom at Twitter with some of his young cousins they all got kind of Giddy and were joking and at one point somebody suggested hey make your pronouns prosecute fouchy now this is something that could both insult uh people who trans insult Anthony fouchy but they all started laughing about it and then finally mus tweeted it out my pronouns are prosecute [Music] fouchy that tweet infuriated people around him it infuriated his girlfriend it infuriated his brother it showed Elon Musk was skittering a bit around that deep Rabbit Hole of conspiracy theories he wants to erode the very fabric of civilization Soros hates Humanity one night musk tweeted about George Soros the Jewish billionaire and frequent Target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories he described him as like magn Mago of course Magneto is a comic book character from X-Men who was a Jewish Survivor himself but Magneto seeks to destroy humanity and when you suggest that someone like Soros a real person wants to do something like that and we've seen how it leads to violence when we use words carelessly it can create consequences and that's what deeply troubled me about what Elon said you know people today are saying he's an anti Semite I'm like a pro Semite on CNBC musk was asked why he continued to risk his business and his brand there a scene in The Princess Bride great movie great um where he confronts the person who killed his father he says offer me money offer me power I don't care I'll say what I want to say and if if if uh the consequence of that is losing money so be it musk's tweets had the power to Marshall an army of followers shortly after he left the company yoel Roth found out what it was like to be on the receiving end when a false accusation surfaced on Twitter that Roth condoned pedophilia musk chimed in Elon Musk with more than 100 million Twitter followers receiv responds to these insinuations that I condone pedophilia and he says this explains a lot the threats against me went from being you're biased and you deserve to die to being you're a child molester and you deserve to die you're trafficking children and you deserve to die I think he's a sexual deviant it seems like a lot of these people that were on Twitter seem to be um child enthusiasts that's the kind of guy that was censoring you that guy that should frighten everybody The Daily Mail went further and published where I live and so at that point it was not just threatening emails and texts and phone calls it was the very real possibility that somebody could show up at my house there were people emotionally activated to fight against a cabal of pedophiles with me apparently as their ring leader I mean what was it like for you for the first time in a long time I was terrified I was no stranger to being harassed online but I feared for my life what would you say to musk in reaction to doing something like that to using his position his power in that way I think there's so many ways that somebody with Elon musk's resources influence and ability to reach the public could Advance the public conversation on issues that matter but to use his power to terrorize a former employee to baselessly accuse a gay man of being a pedophile one of the oldest most offensive most dangerous tropes out there it's inhumane as the attacks on yel Roth continued musk embarked on a new campaign he began to suspend some Twitter users he took issue with for years there has been a Twitter account Elon jet it has been posting where elon's jet is this is public information Elon has hated this Elon jet account and then Elon claimed someone had been stalking his son hi hi hi a stalker came by where he was staying in Los Angeles and he thought well maybe it's cuz they tracked us on Elon jet last night car carrying Lil X in La was followed by crazy stalker who later blocked car from moving and climbed onto Hood if there's one thing sure to trigger Elon Musk it's a threat to his kids and especially this kid X so he shuts down El jet Twitter account Elon jet suspended I did the appeal thing and I just like said you know I don't believe I violated any terms which is surprising given that he's talking about free speech on the platform except if you track where he goes on his private plane in response mus tweeted realtime posting of someone else's location violates doxing policy doxing is revealing the Identity or location or address of an individual online a number of journalists posted links to the public flight pattern that anyone can find and Elon got rid of those people too International criticism raining down on the billionaire after the social network suspended several journalists the Washington posts Drew Harwell the New York times's Ryan Mack and CNN's Donnie Ulan have fallen prey to Twitter's blocking spree he shut down any journalist who had referred to or linked to Elon Jet and it made no sense it really was a violation of this notion of free speech soon musk was prohibiting users from posting links to a rival site as well Twitter suspending accounts of upstart rival service masteron this all comes one month after musk proclaimed he wanted Twitter to be a place of free speech and would Grant quote amnesty to all previously banned accounts and reinstate them I thought that that was hypocritical the idea that Elon is some kind of hero against doxing take some kind of stand against publishing people's personal information is complete and total nonsense reporter Lynette Lopez who' been attacked by musk and his followers before took to Twitter with her criticism within a day she too found herself locked out with no explanation I always say that Elon is a Law and Order guy as long as he writes the laws and gives the orders that's how he felt about free speech on Twitter love Free Speech as long as the speech is mine and I have the freedom to say whatever I want but there were a lot of people on Twitter who didn't seem to get that same respect what he's doing it's like whack-a-mole he sees something and he's going to smack it down but how do you broadly enforce that critics calling the move dangerous and hypocritical amid the criticism musk ran a Twitter poll and ultimately backtracked on the suspensions has been Global backlash after Elon musk's Twitter suspended the accounts of several journalists on Thursday all in podcast now SP even some of musk's allies on the podcast Allin were now questioning his judgment he came in and did exactly what the old regime did which is that he took the rules and he took the quote moderation policies and he found a way to use them to make some editorialized decisions that he thought was appropriate I think that hopefully he gets all this under control over there he finds a good executive team I would like to see him get back to Landing rockets on barges getting to Mars let's getting finish self driving we're almost there musk appeared to be listening after watching the World Cup final with Jared Kushner he asked his followers to respond to another poll should I step down as head of Twitter I will abide by the results of this poll 57% of Voters said yes musk should step down 3 days later he sounded deflated this company is is like like basically you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed uh with the engines on fire and the controls don't work musk said he was going to stay on until he could find a new seat EO but he'd continue to make impulsive decisions Super Bowl Sunday has arrived and Elon Musk flies on his private jet to the Super Bowl he's sitting in the stand watching the game well you got some Brilliant Minds in that photo rert Murdoch Elon Musk and he tweets out basically his support for the Philadelphia Eagles I think his tweet was something like go eagles with a few American flags on it Biden around the same time posts a somewhat similar to tweet Fly Eagles Fly and it's a video of his wife Joel Biden who's walking with an eagles Jersey on the game goes on Elon Musk checks his phone weird it looks like Joe Biden who he's called a damp sock puppet in human form is doing much better than he is in terms of engagement on this very similar tweet Zoe shiffer and her colleague at platformer spoke to multiple sources at Twitter about what happened next by the end of the game the Eagles lose and Elon is completely Furious like something is going on with his account in his mind and so he gets on his jet he flies straight back to Twitter's office in San Francisco at 2:36 a.m. she says an Urgent Message went out and roughly 80 Engineers were pulled into work and they're tasked with fixing the issues with the algorithm what the engineers decide to do do is reconfigure the algorithm so that Elon musk's account is boosted very quickly we're able to talk to people who were in the room at the time and were working on these algorithmic changes and the reason that people are talking to us is that people are pissed at this point the effect was immediate if you use Twitter and you feel like you've been seeing a lot of Alon musk lately you're not crazy the entire four you feed was just Elon Musk because it behooves all of us to be privy to the fresh and original insights of the richest man in the world I was seeing so much Elon and then I tweeted is anyone else's For You tab like just Elon Musk today and it was like hundreds of people were like yes like what is happening musk posted a provocative meme he then denied his tweets had been deliberately boosted at all and blamed a glitch in the algorithm for what had happened so what was it like to observe that going from this free speech soluti who's upset about how Twitter had been wielding its power now he's in charge it seems like he's at this point he's like a king who wants to make up his own rules you know musk feels I'm going to be free I'm not going to be restrained and it can not be a pretty sight at times but that's the musk that also gets things done he's always wanted to be king of the playround amid the chaos of his first months running Twitter musk made another impulsive decision that would reverberate across American politics and have far-reaching implications for free speech online the Twitter files on Free Speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself the public deserves to know what really happened as always he announced it with a tweet are you doing all the people together or you have to musk had assembled a team of writers critical of the mainstream media and given them access to a trove of internal documents in an effort to to expose how Twitter had censored users before he bought it Matt taiii was the first person musk brought in did you come in with any degree of skepticism you know what was his real motivation here what was he using you in some way of course I worried about that of course I worried is he is he using me but what I decided from the beginning was I want to look at the material if the stuff in there looks like it can be confirmed I'm just going to focus on that and I'm not going to worry about his motivations as long as I feel like the stuff in the stories is is right taiii and the team combed through thousands of company emails and internal Communications they started publishing a series of controversial stories known as the Twitter files in the words of Elon Musk here we go he alerted his 119 million followers to a long thread called the Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files Twitter files most major news organizations were skeptical of the Twitter files potentially what is being presented is selective Twitter employees knew what they were doing was but Fox News seized on them it wasn't a Smoking Gun it was a flaming Howitzer some of the most explosive stories revealed that Twitter deplatformed and de Amplified certain users and content apparently I'm on the list sometimes at the request of government I uh wrote a tweet that began it doesn't stop infection or transmission and they banned me we know for a fact that the White House singled out Alex baronson a reporter uh skeptical of the co vaccine uh to be taken down and they deplatformed him that's so far beyond the bounds of what's acceptable Michael shellenberger a writer known for his contentious positions on climate nuclear and Drug policies was part of the project I think the whole point of having a platform is supposed to be reflective of a society and that's going to allow a lot of different views including ones that we disagree with and ones that we think are outright lies it's the whole point of free speech actually a right to be wrong a right to disagree a right to spread you know one person's misinformation is another person's point of view Yol Roth who is this guy yoel Roth was once again singled out Neel Roth again ironically the global head of trust and safety he was accused of secretly suppressing users deemed to be spreading misinformation his name is y Roth Yol Roth you may not know you'll Roth but you need to a lot of people didn't know about George Soros a long time ago were these people getting filtered were they getting you know was were these systems used to basically downgrade their reach yes and Twitter said it would do that in the help center in the Twitter rules when accounts violated the Twitter rules whether it was posting coid misinformation or election misinformation if they did it repeatedly they might get a label like do not amplify on their account account would they know about that they wouldn't Twitter didn't disclose those labels publicly because it didn't have the tools for doing so and I I think that's a reasonable criticism but people act like the whole practice was a mystery and was a conspiracy it wasn't it was in the rules the rules explicitly stated that accounts that violated the rules would receive visibility filtering and they did but I mean address the point directly of of that you were secretly suppressing specific viewpoints especially on the right I don't think that's what the Twitter files show and I don't know that we've done a comprehensive analysis that demonstrates that these actions were skewed or biased one way or the other I think we've seen a handful of cherry-picked examples now I think there's a reasonable question to ask whether accounts on the left and on the right had the same rate of violation of the Twitter rules do Democrats Break The Rules as often as Republicans I don't know that's a really good question that should be studied but when you see a handful of examples of it and conclude that those must be the only types of accounts that received visibility filtering I just I don't think there's enough evidence there to support that conclusion the real winner in this is Elon Musk right he's making Elon Musk was delighted with the controversy even though he was using his own methods to suppress content he didn't like almost every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned out to be true so like is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter that didn't turn out to be true so far they've all turned out to be true and if not more true than people thought the Twitter files team went on to publish portions of emails to Twitter from government agencies and academic institutions that were flagging potential misinformation about vaccines and voting as well as possible foreign efforts to disrupt elections the messages asked Twitter to review the content and consider taking action musk's team claimed it was evidence of a conspiracy to censor Americans Twitter files journalists say the uncovered a sensorship industrial complex they called it a censorship industrial complex the degree to which uh various government agencies had effectively had full access to everything that was going on on Twitter uh blew my mind that's a big claim right that is a big claim to say that there's a censorship industrial complex it also sort of implies that the government is successfully exerting its influence on these companies to infringe upon the First Amendment rights of Americans well I would AR I think they are I think that's probably the case mhm yeah when you say probably the case you mean what I mean is it is it technically against the law I don't know whether it's technically a First Amendment violation it's censorship to me I just think that the fact that they're doing it at all is maybe not legitimate I definitely don't want the Department of Homeland Security making decisions about what can be published and what can't be published or what's going to be Amplified or not Amplified well they're not making decisions they're sending requests as you said to these companies like Twitter right I just don't I don't want them involved at all in doing that and I I don't think I'm alone um I think a lot of people feel the same way according to the Twitter files team a keep part of the so-called censorship industrial complex was a group of academics running a project called the election Integrity partnership I just read the election Integrity committee I get super suspicious oh yeah just the just the name of that I mean Joe they basically would flag hundreds of millions of tweets and tens of millions of them were censored the claims that we tried to censor I think I've seen anywhere from 22 million to 800 million tweets that is a staggering number of tweets there is no Universe in which that could have happened and there is no evidence in the Twitter files that it did because it didn't Renee Desta helped run the election Integrity partnership which was set up in 2020 by academics and researchers studying the problem of misinformation its purpose was to flag election misinformation to Platforms in government both of which were coming under increasing pressure to deal with the issue the goal of it is not to disenfranchise or silence or censor anybody the goal of it is to ensure that the best possible information is out there so that the public can see it and if there had been emails in which we were demanding platforms take things down the Twitter files investigators could have released those but they didn't because they don't exist dur resta's role in the partnership was held out as proof of the so-called conspiracy due to her work as an advis ER to the Senate intelligence committee and her background as a CIA intern one of the big leaders of the censorship industrial complex is this person named Renee Desta it is very hard to get people angry about a concept it is not as hard to rile them up about a person Renee Desta a former CIA fellow at least allegedly former I think she's dangerous and needs to be disempowered Michael shenberger used me and he made me the face of this thing and he took the fact that you know I had interned for the agency as an undergrad which had never been a secret and he somehow turned it into part of a vast cabal you get turned into a character what's that been like well uh it leads to death threats it leads to harassment and it is very very hard for me to refute any of it because in the environment that we live in people who trust Michael schellenberger are going to be disinclined to trust me the Twitter files um claim to kind of uncover this sort of Coalition y right between folks like yourself the academic portion of this government and big Tech and that essentially this all adds up to a censorship industrial complex so what on the face of it what are we supposed to make of that claim well I mean on the face of it there's no actual evidence for it in the Twitter files is the thing that that's been the most remarkable piece to the whole thing is that the evidence does not appear in the Twitter files but you know there's always this grain of truth that provides the seed on which a conspiracy can be built and so is it true that um you know that our team briefs the government yes yes it is is it true that our team talks to Twitter and Facebook occasionally yes we do um that's never been a secret does that translate into we talk to them about the need to take down conservative no absolutely not critics are saying that musk and his allies are misrepresenting the work of Twitter's former management T also admitted that the Trump campaign asked for Content moderation and then he left those links out what is taiii doing there's a lot of omission in the Twitter FS a lot you and your colleagues don't tell us you mentioned in passing for example in your very first thread that the Trump White House made requests of Twitter 2 as the writers of the Twitter files kept publishing they were criticized for multiple factual errors quoting emails without context and jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions do you know what the 22 million number is Matt can you tell me because we checked 22 million came after the election it wasn't in the runup they flagged 3,000 so you were off by 2,997 they said a lot of things I I I stand by my story I've got to ask you because I mean you know both fellow journalists and some of the subjects of your reporting have called out some inaccuracies in the reporting um I mean what what happened there were you were you sloppy with some facts yeah how does that not affect the credibility of what you're going for here I mean I've been doing this for 30 years if you go back and look at my record I haven't had to issue a whole lot of Corrections in my life I try extremely hard to get everything correct in this case we got a few things wrong musk's Twitter files didn't end up proving a grand conspiracy but they did fuel a larger conversation about the relationship between government and social media companies and raised important questions about the extent to which government has been pressuring platforms to remove content we welcome our Witnesses and thank them for appearing today we will Begin by swearing you in would you please stand and raise your right hand Matt taibe and Michael shellenberger were called to testify by Republican Congressman Jim Jordan a trump supporter who for years has insisted that big Tech has been biased against conservatives that is until Elon Musk bought Twitter I mean God bless him we wouldn't know any of this but for the fact that this guy hard workor smart guy who just amazing success story who decided to go by Twitter because he cares so much about the first amendment I think he's been just amazingly transparent and God bless him for doing it now we all know why you guys said at the outset this is the most chilling story and you guys are New York Times bestsellers award-winning uh journalist but in all your your time in the in the journalism field this issue most important and how this I think what' you call it Mr shellberg this complex what' you call it the censorship industrial complex totally this web of censorship big government big Tech NOS all this web of censorship that's what this committee is going to get to and that's not right or left this is just right or wrong this is wrong we know it's wrong and it's about protecting the first amendment when you say that big government is colluding with tech companies like Twitter to censor people what do you mean by censor what ises it what does it actually mean take down political speech um you know take down speech that you that governments labeled as misinformation you step back and you think that's not supposed to be how it works in America but yet that is in fact what was going on you have multiple examples of that uh you know take DS down can you work on removing this one what's happening are you limiting the visibility of this one all from the government to a private company well you say it it's a private company so doesn't the private company ultimately make the decision as to what they choose to promote or suppress or take down you can't have this censorship industrial complex and then get away with saying oh but by the way it wasn't us doing it it was the private company do you think that the government has a role in working with the tech companies to prevent foreign interference with elections what what we're uh what we're focused on primarily is the limitations on political speech this idea that um you know other people who had a different view on certain uh aspects of how um the country dealt with the coid uh pandemic and and the vaccine issue that they were censored um that's our big concern is protecting the first amendment when you start having the government tell you what is misinformation disinformation or the scariest one of all Mal information Mal information is it's true statements but we don't like the context we don't like what people take from that so we're going to we're going to censor that too that is really frightening but again though I'm on the specific issues though in terms of foreign disinformation right do you agree that's a threat yeah no one no one appreciates that no one likes that no one wants that happening but the first amendment is the first amendment you several former Twitter employees were called to testify including Ana ker naari I want to let you know that this is a violation of the First Amendment and the federal government is colluding with social media companies to censor Americans Mr chairman do you think that what you were engaged in Twitter with censorship no I was censorship is done by the government and I've never worked for a government entity the American First Amendment is very clear on who it applies to right the very first words are Congress shall make no law right it is not about private companies it is not about Twitter it is not about Facebook it is not about any of these you know private companies making decisions about speech right companies are have always been allowed to do these things they've always been allowed to regulate their rules and make rules and decide what you can and can't say now Mr Roth you were part of the secretive sip pest censorship team at Twitter correct no sir I'm not sure what that refers to not surprisingly yel Roth came under Fire Mr Roth while at Twitter how many meetings did you have with the FBI I couldn't say for sure but I would say than 10 that's a reasonable estimate I couldn't say for sure more than 50 that seems a bit high in your experience did the federal government use its power to coer Twitter to make decisions about content moderation no do I know whether it was the Federal government's intention to coers the platform no I have no idea but I know that in practice there were no decisions that Twitter made that were the product of a demand from the US government or from any other government to remove content or censor content or restrict content related to the election Twitter made those decisions independently if you step back from it though and you you see the amount of interactions that there were between you and the government agencies FBI and others I mean is there anything potentially problematic about how tight a relationship that was I think it would be a problem if the government were involved in the policing of speech but it's not what happened in reality and in fact the Twitter files show again and again that when we receive requests we evaluate them against our rules and if the conduct violates our policies we enforce them and if it doesn't we don't and if the reports came from the FBI we evaluated them the same way that we would if they came from the DNC the RNC a member of Congress or an ordinary user you know the FBI is a little bit different than you know even the DNC complaining about something it's the FBI right when the FBI comes knocking it's naive to think that that doesn't have some sort of an effect right I mean the fact that they're sending a request might be coercive just by doing so I disagree if you look at the Twitter files you see again and again that my team and I pushed back on the FBI on DHS on anyone who brought us something that wasn't true and wasn't valid Jim Jordan's investigation has also targeted former government officials you're the poster child for censorship yeah yeah even though I never had any intention uh or desire to censor anyone back in April 2022 Nina janowitz was appointed to lead a new board inside the Department of Homeland Security part of a broader Push by the Biden Administration to respond to misinformation in the wake of the pandemic and lies about the 2020 election it was called the disinformation governance board I mean the name is pretty bad right I think it evokes a lot of um kind of you know authoritarian Vibes to it and I understand why people would shiver when they heard it but the idea of the name wasn't that it would be governing all of disinformation in the country it was that it would be governing the Department's response to disinformation when the new board was announced Elon Musk quickly weighed in this is messed up what was the board going to do and what was DHS going to do about disinformation it's less sexy than it might seem we never had any intention of censoring but we as any government agency does look at social media to understand what is happening and in some cases you know with uh things relating to the security of the Homeland elections infrastructure borders uh natural disasters there might be narratives of concern and what the department would then do likely although we never got to this point right we would likely put out good information the problem was the department didn't communicate well at all about uh what the board was and what was filled into that vacuum was a bunch of Lies Nina jankowitz who's like a total idiot obviously this woman is a clear Democrat supporting authoritarian there are concerns from critics about this new executive director Nina Jen as the controversy grew janowitz herself came under attack I want to be clear that it wasn't just criticism this was an allegation that the board was going to be a minister of Truth and that it would have the power to send quote men with guns to the homes of Americans who expressed opinions that the government didn't like that is what Tucker Carlson said about the board and about me men with guns plan to quote identify individuals who could be descending into violence could be descending when a conservative commentator on Twitter compared the disinformation board to Nazi Germany Elon Musk weighed in Elon Musk says the idea that the feds will watch what we say and believe is one thing only discomforting all's well that's or well how did Elon Musk contribute to the controversy swirling around you and the governance board every time Elon Musk responded to any of the conspiracy theories about the board or about me there's almost certainly a bump in the harassment and threats that I received when musk responds to something with his millions of followers it by Nature then kind of surfaces that tweet the backlash put an end to the disinformation governance board before it even got off the ground but the threats continued they really ran the gamut uh a lot of people saying um that I had been committed treason and should pay the price people threatening my child uh who at that point was unborn I was a few weeks away from giving birth um my family and I were doxed so our address was released multiple times I had a private security consultant looking at the dark web for me and he advised me at that point that I probably shouldn't be doing things like going to the coffee shop alone or getting gas alone Jim Jordan's committee accused janowitz of leading an unamerican attempt to establish a de facto Ministry of Truth within the federal government do you think that there have been legitimate questions asked about where the line should be when it comes to the government's role in working on disinformation I think those are reasonable questions that deserve to be discussed in a really nuanced and nonpartisan Manner and that is not what we have having had conversations with people like representative Jim Jordan and Matt Gates because they subpoenaed me and I had to go to a deposition I don't believe that they think that the government is actually censoring people I think that the intention of the campaign against disinformation researchers is to give the Republic party more leeway in how it presents the truth the idea is that they can certainly play fast and loose with uh with the truth and I think that benefits them as we've seen with 2020 January 6th etc etc Congressman Jordan Take a Bow sir you helped get rid of the ministry of Truth um thank you for doing that what do you have to say to the people that believe that this investigation one is creating a chilling effect that will enable people to to spread lies about election Integrity in 2024 and let me ask you no no no I just I think you're going to have to address it and the fact of the matter is address I just can't believe you're asking the question why is that because it's listen I mean the January 6 committee right they they the report said you were a significant player in Trump's efforts to overturn the election results following his defeat and according to the report you participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials what no I mean why is this laughable no because you're saying you're saying that that us investigating the sensorship of speech by Americans is going to have a chilling effect and it's like you've got it backwards they chilled speech big Tech big government press take down these tweets take down this material that's the chilling impact on speech because it doesn't get done and now you're trying to say like Jim Jordan who's investigating this is somehow a chilling speech you got to be kidding me when they censored truthful data the claim that the government has been censoring Americans is now being fought out in the courts a federal appeals court has ruled that the Biden Administration likely overstepped First Amendment Protections in one ongoing federal court case newly revealed Communications between the White House and social media companies have led to a ruling that the Biden Administration likely violated the first amendment in its efforts to Curel misinformation the issue may now be heading to the Supreme Court but the targets of musk's Twitter files say there are already far-reaching consequences social media is a battlefield and I think anybody who's going to war is going to try to skew the battlefield to their advantage one way to do that is to make companies too scared to do what Twitter did for years and I think every platform from now until the end of time is going to think about what it would mean to fact check one of Donald Trump's tweets perhaps we're past that point but for every hearing for every report for every news cycle platforms are going to hesitate just a little bit more before the next time they take some type of politically controversial action all of this work and all of this effort that so many people went and put into attempting to defend our democracies and defend our information ecosystems is very much starting to fall apart Twitter's Bluebird logo is no more El and it was replaced with a giant X by summer 2023 musk's long-term plans for X were finally coming into focus with the company losing money fast he made good on his promise to appoint a new CEO she is Linda Yaro who's just left a top position running ad sales at NBC Universal Elon focuses on product design and I'm responsible for the the rest running the company muskin Yak arino signaled an ambitious New Direction for x a so-called everything app for messaging calls social media posts entertainment payments and more I was joining the company to partner with Elon to transform Twitter into X the everything app she's a very high ranking ad executive probably the one of the top ones in the country maybe she will figure it out maybe they can make it into a big business she thinks she can make it a good home and an effective home for advertisers of course she knows as someone who bought Advertiser maybe it's not a good home for Advertiser well mus isn't a guy who's like failed all that many times I mean he's he's been wildly successful he sends Rockets into space he's got you know an incredible car company cars and Rockets are not media this is harder than rocket science it's not harder or less hard it's just different and just cuz you play basketball doesn't mean you're good at baseball the problem with a lot of these tech people is cuz they think they're good at one thing they're good at everything and that's just not the case okay okay let me let me see is this working go well let's just just make sure this things working first I really appre appreciate Elon coming down and giving an unfiltered uh uh depiction of what's happening on the border this is not like uh you know a piece that's being filmed and then subsequently edited and whatnot this is under musk X is becoming a home to what he calls citizen journalism and a platform for some of the most divisive voices hey it's Tucker Carlson we're told there are no Gatekeepers here if that turns out to be false we'll leave Tucker Carlson started a show on X after he was kicked off Fox News we'll get bigger ratings using this crazy Forum that you're using than probably the debate billionaires want to own media platforms I've never seen a billionaire own a media platform that so obviously is using it as a personal platform he has a megaphone for his perspectives he has used it to maliciously attack people via the quote Twitter files he has used it to spread actual misinformation and I worry about what then is happening behind the scenes and importantly what's going to happen in the next election not just in the US but also other countries around the world on the world stage it's becoming clear that musk's rhetoric about Free Speech does not necessarily extend to other countries Turkish government asked Twitter to censor its opponents right before an election and Elon Musk complied tonight Elon Musk Under Fire after Twitter appears to have censored links to a BBC documentary that's critical of the Indian Prime Minister narandra Modi you know Elon has said that he does not believe in free speech as a concept that goes beyond borders that each country has its own idea of free speech the best we can do um is really to uh uh Hue close to the law in any given country which if you don't want to get kicked out of certain Nations is certainly the business perspective to take Elon desperately wants to get Tesla into India so the fact that he has subjugated his desire for free speech in modi's India does not Shock me at all um I'm confident that that Tesla will in India and we'll do so as soon as uh humanly possible someone very smart said to me this is a guy with other business interests around the world especially space and Tesla and and Starling he needs influence around the world with autocrats and governments when he walks in a room as the head of Tesla okay just another like look Ford walks in it's the same thing he's on the same level but when he's also the owner of Twitter he gets a little more attention and it gives him political power you don't need any introduction you have been always proven right now there is almost not always there are some people who believe that you are genius and there there are some who are you believe that you are EV I am um definitely not evil so yeah hopefully not evil aspirationally not evil um so uh [Music] yeah SpaceX says all systems are go for its launch of the most powerful rocket ever into orbit almost a year since he bought Twitter Elon Musk is more powerful than ever Elon musk's brain chip company is looking for volunteers for its first human trial Elon Musk starting his own artificial intelligence company booster after chamber pressure ninal he's also more controversial than ever Elon Musk threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League's Elon Musk refused to provide starlink access to the Ukrainian military musk has a obsessive belief that there's only one overriding principle and those are the laws of physics if it's policy if it's sentiment if it's anything else you can push back and ignore it the entire Starship stack continu to rotate we should have had Separation by now obviously this is uh does not appear to be a Nal [Music] situation he's willing to shoot off rockets and let them blow up he's willing to fire engineers at Twitter and see if it survives and he feels that we've become a society filled with more referees than innovators filled with more lawyers than doers live view there of our control center at Starbase musk has one rule that guides him which is never be constrained by the rules [Music] go to PBS.org Frontline for more of our reporting on social
