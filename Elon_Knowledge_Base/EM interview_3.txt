[Applause] okay wait I'll just I'll just read off all of your companies Elon I know them but I'm just going to read them to make sure I don't miss one because there's so many now uh founder CEO chief engineer of SpaceX uh CEO product architect and chairman of Tesla uh owner chairman CTO of uh x uh x.com uh founder of boring company co-founder of neurolink and open Ai and president of the mus Foundation did I get everything let your Winner's ride and we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy [Music] with where are you me it is coming it's kind of absurd where are you at Star base um I'm in FL currently so this is this is a starlink and Flake connection are you kidding me that that's oh yeah that works pretty well huh I think there's only one wait I think it's one of of how stalling Works uh in an airplane at altitude there's only one of those in existence right it's on your plane that's it 101 there are a number of airliners that have stalling and there will be a lot more in the future Starling connection when you're assuming it's working properly is you would even be able to tell you you're on the ground or in the air um because unlike Jo satellit the latency is you know really be less than 20 millisecs so um it's a in fact for a lot I think for some people the Sonic connection on the plane will be better than their connection at their house that would be pretty great um H how is um the Starship doing it was incredible to see the first uh launch but I understand you're closing in on the second I know you've been working really hard on that and the team's working hard on it um when do you think you're going to get the next one up and um what are the chances it makes it to orbit uh well we have the second one stacked at Star base so it's ready to go um and uh we finished that up in the last week we believe we've we've completed the rain um I had an requested by the FAA so we should get our license hopefully soon um but really the only thing holding back second plan of Starship at this point is Right fire approval wow what's your expectation uh or your hope in terms of the probability that it gets to orbit it's just a question of timing yeah how long it does take to get the approval paperwork whatnot um so that's really up to the FAA at this point yeah but but what about making it to orbit do you think oh we are doing a new staging technique called hot staging uh where um you light the up the upstage engines or the ship engines while the um boost stage is still firing and um this is the kind of the most efficient way to do is stage separation of rocket going orbit um but we did not try that on the last mission and and we're trying on this Mission we think it will be overall better um but I think this I think probably have a I hope well over 50% chance of getting to Stage separation um and maybe at close to 50% chance of getting to Orit if the hot staging um the new separation method uh is it works so I'd say maybe it's like a you know above i' say probably above 30% chance of getting toor with the sign whereas previously I said below 50 uh is this in terms of complexity how complex is this of a problem compared to the other problems you've worked on in your career uh well so I mean making a rocket that is more the twice the size of the SAT 5 um you know it's a in fact with an extra of the rocket it'll have roughly three times the thrust of a Saturn 5 Moon rocket um whever it's signed to be fully rapidly reusable whereas the you know the SAT was completely Expendable and with baline we we still expand the upper stage uh but we we bring back the boo stage as people have probably seen the The Rocker liing videos and we are also able to recover the varant um with the with falc but these things do land toly out to sea so it takes a while to bring them back to board and get them ready for figh G the the thing that you know so so this's a scale of Starship but then also the fact that it is designed for full and R re usability so both the booster and the ship come back launch site they get caught by these giant meaz arms youve see in congress's Godzilla uh it's basically bad uh catches this giant rocket out of you know B air and puts it back on the launch stand and gets ready for launch so it will be capable of you know basically aircraft level flight rates um but but it's much bigger than say a 747 or 8380 um you want can we um talk about the events of was it last weekend the whole Ukraine Starling thing can you give us like a the Tik Tok of like what's going on and like how you're being forced to decide but like what is it like in that decision room if there was one or wherever you were where you're trying to figure out am I keeping this on do I turn it off what is going on people must have been bombarding you whatever you can share about what that was like how you made the decision um yeah I I so I was actually mistaken a little bit in understanding the situation um you know obviously we St sex have provided uh starlink connectivity for you know to Ukraine um really since the beginning of the war uh really within a I think a few days of the war starting um and as the Ukrainian uh Governor said the S was instrumental in the FS of Ukraine so you know they've said that really many times although the media forgets to mention that um so and in fact they've said it on Twitter you X only know on his Twitter it's going to take a while to get that right yeah take a little time [Laughter] um so you know you don't have to you don't have to take my words for it you just read what what they put um you know uh so uh so son has been incredibly helpful to the Ukraine war eff um we' have gone out of pocket very significantly uh to help them um and um at at the time this happened the uh region around Crimea um was actually turned off now the reason it was turned off was actually originally was because United States had sanctions against Russia um and we're not allowed to actually and that includes Crimea and the sanctions and we're not allowed to actually turn on uh connectivity to sanction the country without explicit government approval um we did not have from the US government so um so so basically the uh uh you know Ukraine didn't they didn't give us any any advanced warning or heads up or anything um we just got the the sort of uh urgent calls from the Ukrainian government saying that we needed to turn on primier it's like in the middle of the night basically and we're like what are you talking about you know you which's it four um you know and then you know we basically um figured out that this was kind of like a bhit type attack on um Sasol on the Russian fet Sasol so they're really asking us for to to really for actually take part in a major act War um and um you know well we so certainly have huge EMP support for the Ukrainian government um the Ukrainian government is not in charge us uh people or companies that's not how it works and and Elon if if I could just but I should say that you know although I'm not President Biden's biggest fan if if I had received a Presidential Directive to turn it on I would have done so because I do regard the president as the chief executive officer of the country whether I want that post to the president or not I S respect the office and so if if you know if we gotten if I gotten a request from the president type of thing from the American president to be clear um then I I I would have turned it on you know so but no such requests came through that that's a really that's a really interesting point and um you're I mean the what jamas is referring to is you're now being attacked I saw there was a you know there was Jake Tapper uh the other day on CNN interviewing our secretary state was just he was all lathered up basically attacking you for this uh David David I mean to his credit secetary Lincoln was actually quite supportive despite the Absurd uh you know accusations and leading questions of the Jake taper at CN yeah he didn't take the bait credit to sery Lincoln in this regard for not um you know taking the bait at all yeah well I to me this is an example of no good deed goes unpunished because if you had never given I hope I hope some good deeds back go unpunished I mean if you if you had never given Starling that you know but yeah I mean my point is just if if you had never given Starling to the Ukrainian government for free voluntarily you just volunteered it then no one be attacking you right now for not turning it on so they could do their attack on Crea yeah um also one other thing I'll note is that your reason for not turning it on which is you don't be part of what could be a major escalation was exactly was exactly the reason that Biden Administration did not give attam attam missiles to Ukraine at that point in the War now they may be changing their minds but they were very worried about an attack the administration was an attack on Crea triggering some huge escalation of this war so not only did you not receive a directive from President Biden your thinking was very much in line with theirs at the time and and you're being attacked for that now there there's something you mentioned which is that you did this at a lot of economic cost to SpaceX can you just can you just talk about that for a second because I'm not sure people understand who's paying for what right now and who hasn't been paid and you know Etc there is um well as you say like a lot of people are contributed to the effort uh staring is the fundamental communication backbone of the Ukrainian uh government and and essential services like First Responders and that kind of thing um and you know is is used we we hope peacefully relatively peacefully on the warfront it is the only thing that works on the warfront everything else is been jamed by the Russians so it the only thing that works not not one of the [Applause] things you know but but I think you have to sort of think of say the you know um you know taking the actual example of Paul har and say like well how did that work out for Japan it didn't work out well at all right um because it was a a tactical victory a strategic defeat it enraged the American public um who sort of naturally wanted Vengeance for for the Z you know the Zach and I think that that you know while I don't think it's on the same scale that there was certainly that potential of sort of a many P Hava with results in a mass escalation of uh hostilities um but not this would this would not this would not defeat Russia it would enrage Russia do you Don do you donate the network or do they pay you for it sorry yeah so um I'm actually not sure what the final accounting is at this point but uh I I I think at one point at one point you calculated our sort of cost of supporting things that roughly $100 million now the $100 million does not count um the mass of risk to the entire Starling constellation uh because uh Russia would like to have the entire thing deleted um so uh you know nobody's compensating us for that um and uh so if we were to get say uh our control center were uh take down and Cyber attack they you know they command satellites to the over um and destroy the entire system uh or use anti satellite weapons um so you know the these are this is a pretty significant risk um for which we have not received any compensation and obviously would be catastrophic to the entire stalling system which is you know approaching $10 billion Elon do you think the current government Administration saying hey 10 mil million and then actually I say one of the BR meing things was as you as you've seen there's there's a very large amount of money that's been appropriated for uh Ukraine you know I'm not sure what the the total is at this point but must be 100 close billion or somewhere between 80 and 100 billion um you know now all of the you know other sort of providers us providers of support to Ukraine are being paid so then why should SpaceX be excluded that doesn't make sense we we're doing one of the most valuable things and yet are getting the least money this iser um but you know despite that we're still happy to keep keep going and um Elon does the Biden Administration have it out for you and why H what have gave you that idea [Laughter] yeah but let me ask you own and control I don't if the whole Administration has it out me I think there probably aspects of the administration that are not uh or or you know as aspects of you know interests aligned with uh with with with resent Biden who probably do not um wish good things for me um I don't know you know really what their issue is but there does seem to be um a significant increase in the weaponization of government um and um I say really sort of misuse of prosecutorial discretion in a many many areas where and I think this is this is really a dangerous thing for um you know for I don't know for that to be potis and politics with with with government agencies it's it's just really and then I think from you know from from say uh you know Democratic party standpoint or or say B Biden Administration standpoint I think this is this the danger here is that if there's significant uh um must use prosecutorial discretion let's say one says okay everyone's equal under the law yes but who are you who are you choosing to pursue um and if if you if you're pursuing what what appeared to Independent voters to be uh trivial cases while ignoring serious crimes um it's hard to imagine that a lot of independent voters that's going to win over thoughtful independent voters did this did things change when you bought X yeah I think that they did change somewhat um you know I I'll go with the with with the sort of you know the xplatform is really to be uh a Level Playing Field a public square that is supportive of um you know most of the country let's say that the middle 80% or something like that um now um that's not been the case really for all social media that all social media have been really very very left leading far left leading and really Twitter was far left leading um you know the the suspensions of of um s Republican candidates or interests or voices was was uh really at least 10 times the rate of of um suppression of left left bring voices on you know on all Twitter um so so what what I'm trying to do is move it to the middle which from standpoint of say the left appears it is moving to the right Everything's Relative if you're standing on the left but it's not it's simply moving to the middle that's all um in an attempt to actually represent the whole country um and and not just um here half the country or even maybe less than half the country so that's it really so I think there's like there's really to be alarmed about here it's you know it's just that it's intended to be a Town Square inclusive of the whole country and else you know and and the world that's all it it's been um I guess you took over um X Twitter on Halloween weekend if I remember correctly uh when you got to the building you got the keys um and David and I were lucky to be there with you when you got the keys and we got to um check things out um this is 10 months into a turnaround uh and it wasn't a high functioning organization I think when you took it over where is the company at now and are you pleased with I guess the progress because it looks like new features are getting launched the product velocity is great uh obviously advertising's been challenging but it feels like there's some green shoots so so how do you feel about the purchase now yeah well I should say we recently seen a significant increase in advertising which is great um so that's a you know if that Trend continues um I think the company will be in in very good Financial shape on the advertising front um so that in terms of positive developments that that seems to be one of them um and um from a feature standpoint I think those who are look using the system I think we' I think we might have delivered more new features you know in the last I know a year than in the last you know all tter did in 5 years you know there there really feature the feature development pace is very rapid um and this is being done with really about 15% of the original company um maybe a little more 15 20% um so it's it's really you know efficient you know at the end of the day you have to say you know how complicated is a system uh like the X Twitter platform um you know how different is it from a group chat frankly it's like a group chat at scale um so he I don't think you need an army to maintain a group chat yeah yeah I mean it's it's not the self-driving platform and it had maybe 10 times as many people working on it as the self-driving platform at Tesla which seems crazy the entire self-driving AI software team is 200 people and the what they're doing is much more complex than Twitter or you know much a lot more so you now there's other things that obviously need to be done like advertising sales um OB network operations and um how can you talk to it's really not it's not a it's not a huge I don't like I said don't even know me for for for what we're here and I think you know the people that that are um still the company are obviously being very productive in uh creating and deling new features um and um you know we keep seeing sort of RedBoard usage and the the know the most prous number is really the is user seconds as reported by the mobile device especially iOS the the iOS uh what iOS reports as the screen time is the is the least gameful metric um and and those numbers are exem are very good um so you know I think I'm course justly optimistic about where things are headed and I I feel like the company's turned just you know just recently turned turn a corner um tell us about you know said um at least moderate prosperity and and hopefully significant tell us about um the success of sharing Revenue why did you do it and then just the the vision you have for just the Creator economy and what you want that to evolve into and build into yeah I mean it sounds to reason that if if you're a Creator and you need to um need to make a Livy for what you're doing um so there's got to be um you know Fair compensation competitive compensation for a Creator whether they're doing you know WR their writing or pictures video whatever the case may be um and uh so we're and we're so we're not really in you know inventing anything new here we're just you know as YouTube does with creators they will do rev show um with advertising and so we're doing rev show with advertising um we're also to have enabled direct subscription to accounts where whatever somebody you know you could be doing audio video long form text anything and you can subscribe to someone and um that's you know OB that's way for a subscriber to make a living as as well you know for a Creator to make a living so the intent is for the ACT platform to be the best home for creators uh where if you've got interesting content then you you want to put it on a platform and um you know there's a lot of questions about like sort of the algorithm and whatnot I I should mention like the the algorithm is uh I think almost all of it is open sourced and and we will uh I think quite soon have the entire open source uh the only reason I it really hasn't been done entirely open source yet is because we're somewhat embarrassed with the code and need to just clean it up before uh putting something extremely embarrassing out there but the point is that like we want transparency boths trust and if you've got um uh if you if you can recreate the results um on the xform of how viral a post is going to be independently using the uh you know the the public algorithm you know the H algorithm um that that's really where we want to get to um so you you kind of you kind of know what to expect um and and why something happened um now now I should say the we are we are trying to optimize for uh user time um on the platform what this naturally means is that um posting content that someone looks at longer is going to get higher priority than content that is short uh just because the system is trying to Max it's it's aspiring to maximize uh you unreg user remittance is what I call it so like basically how do we um if we're succeeding you want to spend more time on the platform and you want to and after having spent that time you don't want to regret it um I mean speaking of Tik Tok um you know that's I've had a lot of people tell me they spend a lot of time on Tik Tok and they regret it um we don't want to be we want it to be that you spend a lot of time on the xplatform and you learned a lot uh you you're entertained and you don't regret it so when you're optimizing for you know user minutes and like I said aspirationally under regretted use minutes uh uh if you the more content that you post on the system the more reach that uh thing will get because the system is saying oh those user is spending more time in the platform because they're they're you know seeing say your podcast or uh reading um a long form article or watching some video um that's going to get a lot more time than say if you if you link to a video elsewhere or you link to an article elsewhere that that that's just that that that that means you'll you will be on that post for a very short period of time and so the the system will be like okay that did not increase uh user time so it will it won't be excluded it it will get less attention that than actually posting content natively on the system do you want to talk um about uh the ADL and you uh sort of where what the status of that is whether you're pursuing a lawsuit or not or where that stands um I think we'll have to see about that I mean um yeah I mean the fact of matter is that ad did initiate a boycott they don't call it a boycott they call it a pause but you know po that is never ending isot so and and and we just we saw a massive drop in uh us advertising we saw basically no change in advertising in Asia but domestically with ADL is strong we saw uh 60% drop in advertising so you know that's uh pretty intense um and um and this is despite you know showing repeated uh analyses of the system including third party analysis of the system which actually showed that uh the number of uh views of hateful content uh declined so you know the third parties who have all the data analyz and said actually there's less safe speech um the issue I think with the ADL is not a question of hate speech it's not a question of any semitism obviously uh it's that the ad um and a lot of other organizations have become activist organizations um which are acting far beyond their uh stated mandate or their original mandate and and I think far beyond what donors to those organizations think they are doing um you know one of the things that the a was extremely opposed to and in fact was instrumental in in happening was there the ad was instrumental in getting um Donald Trump the platformed um and then when we we you know we restored the account um they they made it super clear that they regarded simply restoring his account on you know Twitter now uh that that that constituted hateful speech like he hasn't even said anything you know um he has to at least say something or post something for there to be incremental painful painful content this is absurd um and what's this got to do with anti-Semitism like you know Donald Trump's son-in-law is Jewish his Jewish gr I'm pretty sure he's not anti-semitic okay um you know he's at the wedding so um this this so so the problem is that a lot of these um organizations like said they've really been captured by the W agenda and they're they're pushing um you know serious of beliefs and values that I think are often contrary to their what what they're done as belief and that's uh that's what we have in the situation well yeah I I'll note that the the two positions that you've taken that have brought the most heat on you number one defending Free Speech number two advocating peace and how dare you how dare you how dare you and there's there's an article like the opposite world or something yeah we're living in upside down World there there's an article in today's New Yorker calling you a super villain because you're advocating peace and protecting the first amendment I mean it's like completely upside down do you want people to eat their vegetables you at this point you literally cannot tell actual press from parody no like if that was a bon be or onion no literally you're doing a you're doing and and change the banner to you know Babylon b or whatever onion or something like that par some parody thing and be like oh that's a good joke you know um yeah super bones normally advocate for peace that's you know of course um we want to get rid of all the nuclear weapons hey um hold that's uh what the funniest the funniest skit that didn't make it on SNL that we were worksh Shing was probably woke James Bond and we wanted to do like this woke James Bond and Eli will tell you some of the jokes it was pretty hilarious but then we were just talking about a story that broke in the guardian about the new James Bond novel and short story is to woke and it's literally the parody we did two years ago uh Elon speaking of Peace we had we had a grais reality also like the you know the uh you know conspiracy theories that that that haven't come true list is you know quite short um sees that turn out quite short um and we really need more conspiracies generated because we're running out of to find the [Laughter] truth okay check off is accurate um so uh I don't know who's the you know responsible these conspiracy theories but but you know we just need some more material paging Alex Jones Elon we had Graham Alison here today I know you talked about his book we had Ray Doo here we had Ro kna um and we talked a lot about China the US relationship with China you are you have several businesses that have deep supplier and customer relation uh ships in China given what's going on and clearly the tenor has changed the the mood has changed with respect to US policy towards China what it's like in DC what it's like in Silicon Valley and how everyone talks about the relationship with China today it's pretty crazy how quick things have changed um as a business leader with all these business relationships with China how do you make decisions and and how things are changing and how do you think about where this is headed sure well I mean let's just clarify here um you know SpaceX has no uh SpaceX of Starling have no in China whatsoever they're not they're not allowed you know SpaceX does launch uh China satellites and starlink is abandon in China so to be clear SpaceX starlink zero business in China um uh in the case of of Tesla uh one of our of our four vehicle factories uh one is in uh China so um you know it's a it's a significant car market uh but it is uh you know so what I'm trying to say is like the by far the bulk of of my business interests if if I I would peing MTI which I Aspire not to be um are Outsider China let's just be clear about that um then with respect to now that said I think I understand China well I've been there many times I've met with uh the senior leadership um at many levels of China for for many years and so I I think I've got a pretty good understanding um at least as an outsider of ch so and and Tesla has been very successful domestically in China so um you know the fundamental thing here is is really Taiwan um the China has well really since uh for like half a century or so uh maybe longer at this point longer at this point their policy has been to to um s reunite Taiwan with China uh from this standpoint you know it may be just analogous to like Hawaii or or something like that like an integral part of China that is arbitrarily not part of China um mostly because of the US stop has us Pacific Fleet has stopped uh any any sort of um reunification effort force um so now really things getting to the point um increasingly year-over year uh where China's military strength is increasing and ours is more or less uh static and strategically you know you can imagine trying to defend Taiwan is not not easy because it's it's very close to the coast of China um so there will come a point if you know Pro probably not not too distant future where China's military strength in that region far ex exceeds US military strength in that region and if one is to take uh China's policy literally and probably one should um then there will be some forceful uh for forceful beuse for you know uh to incorporate Taiwan into China this is what they've said um that if if there is not a diplomatic solution there will be a solution by force let me um if I can and so really what's going on here you've seen you know this in in many areas and I think this Tempo is going to increase is that you know both China and the US are preparing for a potential Showdown uh you know in the South China CA so um that's why you're seeing increasing restrictions on export of us technology to China uh but such as the the Nvidia you know the Nvidia h100s being and you not allow to ship to China um and I think there'll be more and more you you also not not allow to ship Advanced ship making equipment to China um so and I suspect you know you know China is going to respond with some reciprocal sanctions um and you'll I think you'll see this kind of a TI T reciprocal sanctions increasing in the next next few years so I think quite a very uh hot temperature um and then we'll see this is there going to be a a diplomatic solution to uh re reunification or a non- diplomatic solution you uh but has made it clear that there will one way or another be a solution from their standpoint Yeah you mentioned uh Nvidia so let me just talk about Ai and bring it back to that for a second can you tell us um your regrets but also the positives of the experience you had with open Ai and then what your goals are with X well the AI discussion is is certainly a long one or could be a long one um you know digital super intelligence that might be the most significant technology that Humanity ever creates um and and it has the potential to be more dangerous than and um nuclear weapons so um you know in the case of creating opening eye it was to have there not be a unipolar world where um Google with its subsidary deat mine uh you know would control an overwhelming amount of AI talent and compute and and resources um which then is somewhat dependent on basically how how Larry paage U and serge BR um and Eric believe things should go because they they between three of them or two out of three have control over alphabet because they've got super voting rights and um you know I was quite based on some conversations I had with lar paig uh where um you know you call me a species for being pro humanity and um so I'm like what side of you on there you know uh um you know I think and uh so so I felt like uncomfortable um having the entire future of digital super intelligence be in the hands of someone who equ a species for being pro Humanity um you know how can it not be uh so that's opening eye was originally created as an open source nonprofit and now is a close to be it should be renamed closed for Max no profit AI um it is it is closed um and they are aiming to I think make try to make a100 billion I think according to S get $100 billion from somewhere for some vast amount of compute uh to create digital god um apparently all the waste are stored in a common separated value file by the way so our dig God will be a CSV file how do we import it file import um see what happens um so so anyway so so now opening uh is also very closely line with Microsoft you know Microsoft is really you um the open servers are running on in Azure and Microsoft data centers you know so really what you have is I think at the end of day Microsoft having more control than open AI they have access to all the source code they have access to all the weights of the um you know gb4 and future versions so they have all rights to this to to thing it's not um at any point really they could cut off open AI I don't think open AI quite realizes that the dependence on on Microsoft and even if Microsoft does break some contract they'll just be tied up in litigation for you know for years um so really you've got a contest between kind of like Google and Microsoft Google as mentioned I'm concerned about you know uh sorry not not caring enough about AI safety and um good reason and then Microsoft just is is a I think you know a profit seeking organization um and I you know I think such is great but um I I can't say like you know that it would difficult to to say that that m has a has an amazing track record and moral decision- making so um diplomatic anyway so so so was like okay look let's just so I think let's try to create a third company that is competitive I I I do think Tesla is underated from an AI standpoint in terms of real world AI Tesla has the best real world AI so uh you know hopefully between uh xai and Tesla there's kind of a third Contender or would you look you've done you open source your patents at Tesla you are very Pro open source your source code at X would you ever considering releasing dojo and FSD more as a platform substrate for everybody else or that's sort of off the table right now well I don't know if that's uh you know in the case of say Dojo or our inference Hardware that's in the car our inference inference computer which is actually a lot lot more comp than Dojo by the way um you know we've got I know somewhere in the order of 4 million cars that have um highp speeded Ai and Par computers in them um like open sourcing chip designs doesn't mean you you suddenly get that thing yeah you know so um you can open open source the software but I think chip designs it's only ones that could actually use those chips or really kind of yeah would be some someone that's willing to spend many billions of dollars on um on a computer development so anyway I think I think in the case of uh you know don't saying Optimus is really interesting um any I think just in general Tesla is uh one of the most leading AI companies um and in some respects the leading AI company when it comes to real real world AI understanding the real world and and actually reacting to that with self-driving um and so and I think that will become part of the the solution for AGI or general super intelligence so um in the case of Tesla I think we've got a sort of a good governance structure in that there's no super voting rights or anything like that so if I'm you know go crazy the CH of Tesla can vote me out um you know I have enough vote to be you know I think moderately influential but not enough to stay in even if I'm doing crazy stuff so I think that's actually good um great um I was told we have to wrap him at oh okay uh just on FSD before we wrap I'll let you go um we were talking earlier this year and you said uh hey maybe chat GPT 4.0 like moment for self-driving was coming and uh I've I've been playing with the beta and um yeah how how close does it feel to you because it it some of the rides it's been doing for me are pretty darn impressive the latest beta is pretty incredible yeah it's pretty pretty neat I you know I used to love it on the highways and on the streets I'd be like okay but now I'm using it increasingly on the streets so where do you how do you feel about it right now and I I guess you made a lot of predictions on it over the years um but it it does feel like it's getting pretty close yeah I think it's I think it's very close to uh you know being in a situation where even if there's no human oversight or intervention that the probability of uh a safe journey is is higher with FSD and no supervision like even if you're seep of the car than if the person is driving um we're very close to that you know those that have the FSD beta which really anyone could get at this point um so the the the miles we see driven under the FSD beta currently are much safer than the miles that are driven without it so um that's uh you know that's that's already very good milestone um but you know you can just see that it's getting better and better like um if you see if you compare the uh you know FS beta today versus 6 months ago versus you know a year ago versus 18 months ago it's really the Improvement is dramatic um and um we've got the final piece of the puzzle which is to have the control part of the car uh transition from about 300,000 lines of C++ code to also neural network so the you know the whole system will be neural net in your network um phons into controls out and and that that that's kind of the final piece of the puzzle for fullop driving being significantly better than human W awesome uh thanks for taking the time buddy uh fly safe and I'll see you shortly uh ladies and gentlemen Elon mus thanks bud [Applause] [Music] and instead we open sources to the fans and they've just G [Music] crazy Bes myg taking [Music] driveway oh man we should all just get a room just
