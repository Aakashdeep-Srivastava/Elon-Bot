Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all [Music] day me take my dog cool yeah like looking in the mirror have you seen that before did people get you one of those yeah he's awesome he's awesome he's pretty edgy yeah he's it's amazing that he puts out a piece of art per day 365 days a year yeah I was following him on the xplatform FK Twitter uh but it was some of it was too jarring too jarring some of the images yeah well cheers sir happy Halloween cheers thanks for doing this appreciate it you're welcome thanks for rolling up in the Cyber truck too yeah I got a chance to look at it in the factory but that was uh almost uh was that like a year and a half ago or so was it it was a while ago yeah a year ago I guess yeah at least a year at least a year and it's it's different in real life like you see it in person like you images are just we were talking about it outside that you just can't contextualize them yes it looks so odd that you have to see it in the flesh it looks like uh computer Graphics in reality yeah it's the coolest looking [ __ ] production car that's ever been made it's bu prooof literally literally literally yeah one of the videos uh we're going to show is uh just going all like full El Capone just like El Capone showed up and and emptied uh you know the entire magazine of a Tommy gun into the side of the car you'd be okay the only thing that's not bulletproof is the glass the the glass is optionally bulletproof oh it is optional if you want it you can well you can make anything bulletproof if you want but the the glass has to be very thick for it to be bulletproof um so it can't go up and down so if you want fixed glass ah um then how do you order drive-thru yeah exactly yeah that's problem aw you gotta pull ahead and open the door get out but it's okay you can just duck yeah you can just duck um how far away are you from Full like delivering them to people have has anybody gotten them yet um we planted out first deliveries uh next month oh wow so now it's just testing and [ __ ] around uh the hard part by far is manufacturing not not designing the the car uh so um you know there's just not really a movie about that but there should be um so in the sort of the um you know the movies will always be about the sort of inventor who invented the car and then the job is done right that's all invented the object uh now the job is done this is not true that's the easy part the the hard part is manufacturing by far why is it so much harder than making an individual model um well the the in in order to make it affordable you have to make it at at volume so you've got to make everything um at at high rate consistently um if if you if you tour the the production line you'd have a sense for it um you've got to have all of the casting machines all of the stamping Ma maches as the case may be the glass machines the the wheels the tires uh everything required from the motor the the battery cells all of the constituents the battery cells um all of the Silicon that goes in there the chips um it is the manufacturing is somewhere between 100 and a thousand times harder than making a prototype whoa um and then if you want to say like you want to get from um once you reach volume manufacturing which is insanely difficult uh then you want to make the car affordable it's harder to say reduce the the uh cost of the car by 20% than it is to get to volume production in the first place um so I I really cannot emphasize enough um how hard production is relative to design I'm not saying you the design is Trivial because you have to have taste and you have to know what to make um if you don't have a taste and judgment that then your prototype will be bad um but it is uh it is tral really to turn out prototypes and it is extremely difficult to to build a factory and how much more difficult is it to make this considering the bodies made out of steel it's a very difficult um the difficulty of manufacturing is proportionate to the amount of new technology that you have in a car and or in the product and in this case there's a lot of new technology the production line will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky um and most foolish uh part of the entire production line and you could say to First approximation there are 10,000 things that have to go right at least for production to work so if you have 99,999 things that are working and one that isn't that sets the production rate Yeah by far the hard in fact the the the really the the amazing thing about automobiles was not so much the invention of the automobile but the the invention of the factory the mass manufacturing and for that Henry Ford deserves a tremendous amount of credit um uh he was Next Level genius um in fact Ford is really responsible for the entire Mass manufacturing industry uh because he he actually founded Cadillac which was the the heart of General Motors then got kicked out then started Ford really yeah then everyone everyone just copied him do you know he made one of his first cars out of hemp well he used hemp fiber for panels okay yeah it's a there's fascinating video of him banging on it with a hammer because hemp is H bizarrely durable when it's uh compressed and when they take the fibers and I I don't know what kind of epoxy they use or something to put it all together but what what it makes with the the actual physical form of it is insanely light like fiberglass light but very very durable see if you can find the video it's kind of crazy hry for is banging on uh it was the hood of it with a hammer here it is so this was like look at that that crazy that was wild I don't know why they stopped making them out of that that was from 1941 how much does the Cyber truck weigh uh depends on configuration but it's about I know 7,000 lb oh six there different ver but 6 7,000 lb it's it's like similar to like it's a heavy truck like a Ford F250 or something like that yeah and it because of uh all of the the the metal and the weight and everything like that but with the engines that you have it's still the 0 to 60 is pretty bizarre right it's like 35 or something like that well I get the 0 to 60 below three seconds below three yes wow for the you know the beast mode version so we've got a beast mode version that's uh um so there's there's there's well I don't want to give it all away right now but um there there are three demonstrations one of them people are aware of which is uh you know emptying a Tommy gun into the side of the car um a shotgun 45 and a 9 mil and no penetrations wow and that that come it comes that way from the factory can I try it with an arrow yeah it'll be fine you think so I mean I bet I can get in a crossbow might I have a 90 lb compound bow that shoots 520 grain arrows at 300 feet per second with a I think an razor sharp Broadhead we going try right now if you want I wish I had it with me um I don't is it at your house or something yeah should we send someone to go get it do the demo tonight that would be interesting I'll maybe I'll drive back with an arrow sticking out of my car I bet I can get in there okay I'll bet you can't really yeah about your dollar damn I'd like damn I think I think if you have a a crossbow that's with with enough Force you might a crossbow thing about a crossbow is the bolt even though it's very fast it's not going to be nearly as heavy you you won't have as many you you can make a a heavy crossbow bow you could yeah but generally uh crossbow bolts are considerably lighter they're much smaller you know and they they they're much faster they're they're moving at like 400 500 feet per second easy yeah I mean the the thing that matters is kind of the energy per unit area so um so interesting like like a like a 9 Mo or 45 which is basically sort of a 10 Mo um the the 45 is they're roughly the same but the the 45 actually slightly worse penetration not a 9M you know what I just realized I do have some broadheads I do have some broadheads and I have a less powerful bow but I have an 80 PB bow back there I think we should do it absolutely okay when you want to do it right now yeah I can do it right now okay let's do it right now let's now [ __ ] yeah let's do it sick we'll be right back this could be funny I just like why does he have an arrow sticking out of his car this show is sponsored by better help it's a really healthy good thing to talk about what you're going through with people the good and the bad don't keep

hp.com [Applause] Jr bring it back you know had the Arrow come back in I mean just Weare Ricochet like you might want to do it at a slight angle you know what I [Applause] mean it is bar blew the BW the arrow apart yeah flatten the tip of the arrow look at the tip of the Broadhead that's impressive hey cutie thank you well now we know so uh we uh just shot an arrow into it and it barely scratched it barely scratched it yeah it was probably moving 275 ft a second that was a 525 grain is arrow with uh yeah even more than that CU it had the 125 grain head so that was 545 grains that's impressive yeah very impressive it just destroyed the Broadhead Broadhead flattened at the tip and then the arrow blew apart yeah amazing yeah it's uh like I said you um we have a cool video we'll show at the Handover event next month which is emptying an entire magazine of a Tommy Gun which think like on the order of 50 rounds uh just go you're just going full El Capone you know like on the side of the car shotgun 9 mil 45 and you built it like this just for fun well I mean uh cuz it's cooler I mean cuz you can you know uh trucks are supposed to be tough right yeah so is your truck Bulletproof no mine is mine is definitely not exactly and if I shot mine with my my bow would go right through it 100% 100% if if you if you shoot any normal car unlike in the movies where people hide behind car doors uh car door is basically a very thin mild steel uh so uh if you if you shoot a gun at through through like a regular truck it'll go out it'll go through both doors so um it's you can't hide behind a a carard door like they do in the movies you know the back way back in the day dating myself at the The A Team where they would like you know they'd be like bullets flying everywhere and they'd be hiding behind the car door right that doesn't work um but it doesn't a cyber truck did was there ever invest in apocalyptic technology yeah well you know it's an amazing car to have in the apocalypse yeah doesn't it also does does it still do this thing where the the ride height raises so you can and there's also no regular drivetrain so there's no axles that correct are the uh impediment to going over rocks and things like that yeah normally in a in a in in other vehicles ging or diesel vehicles you've got the um differential which uh hangs down low between the the rear wheels so you like look under a car under a truck it's there's almost always a differential there that's hanging out pretty low so if you hit the diff on a on a rock you'll break it yeah but there's no there's there's no um at the bottom of the sub truck is completely flat and has the best clear height of any any vehicle how far away are we if it's ever going to happen at all from having a vehicle that can operate entirely on solar well you've got a sof area thing um so it's about a kilowatt per square meter normal to the sun roughly um so you just it really depends on what kind of mileage you you you can't um you don't have enough surface area to keep the car going just from the carfts area but if you had like something that that folded out you you could um you could make it self sustaining something that folded out so like you could park it and then leave it on yeah you'd have to like unfold like like the Starling satellites do where you unfold the the solar panels you know just you just need more surface area you need um is there any potential potential for an advancement in technology that would make a smaller area much better at conducting Sun nothing uh no it's it's a kilowatt per square meter uh that that's what you're going to get when the sun if you're if you're normal to the Sun so at 90° to the Sun and there's nothing that could accelerate that or no that's just literally the the solar it yeah so then you then you multiply your efficiency by that so if you commercial panel is like maybe 25% efficient if they're a good one so you get like 250 wats per square meter 10t car what was it like a Fisker that was using a solar panel that uh claimed that it was operating like the the electronics like it could start the radio it yeah um I mean you you you can definitely you just it you just don't have enough surfice area for for it but like um but you you you can like certainly um you could run a house with solar with the with the solar roof and the Tesla solar roof you can run a house but it's never going to get to a point where you can just have a car that's made out of solar panels that it could drive around just could never be that efficient correct so you do not have enough surface area what what research or what what breakthroughs have been made in terms of Battery Technology like how far away are we from having batteries that are far more efficient and last far longer cuz I know there was some talk of like sodium based batteries the batter battery range is uh not a problem at this point I mean the the model S will go 400 miles model model 3 Model Model y will do over 300 miles so you know that's that's that's more than most people need so yeah right but are we I mean how far we are we from making batteries that are more efficient this is like we obviously haven't least saying this is not really a constraint um at the point in which you've got a car that can do let's say even at high at highway speeds uh 250 miles then um or let's say turn 40 Mi uh at 80 mph now you're driving for 3 hours straight um and so if you start a trip at say 9:00 a.m. by noon you want to startop for lunch go to the restroom grab a coffee by the time you come back your car is charged how long does it take to fully charge uh yeah like half an hour well you don't want to it's a the people will get used to it because it's a little different um you know uh like for a gasoline car you you'd want to fill it up for an electric car you you You' want to actually go very close to zero and the car can calculate how much range it has with Precision so if you if you put say enter a road trip in in a Tesla it'll it'll calculate um all of the supercharges along the way where where you should stuff how much you should charge and just just let the computer do its thing and it'll it'll it'll work well um so you actually want to uh charge to about 80% and then run it down all the way to 10% I say or less do do you want to do that on everyday use as well or just with long trips no just long trips if you're trying to minimize the amount of time you you stop when charging um so let's say you want to you know stop for 20 30 minutes uh then um you you really it's it's a little counterintuitive because for a gasoline car you would fill it up for for a battery um the the charge State tapers off as you get above 80% you can think of it like the it's I think the right analogy here is cars in a in a parking lot so the the lithium ions are trying to find a parking space um as they as they move across um you know from one side of the battery to the other side from you know cathode anode I mean they're they're sort of just these ions are just bouncing around looking for a parking space so when the parking lot's empty it's you they can zip right in there and find a spot it's easy um as the parking lot gets full just like trying to find a parking space at a mole you have to hunt around for a spot and and that's that's how that's basically what's going on is the the ions are looking for a parking spot um so as the battery gets closer to full it's harder and harder to find find a spot they have to bounce around more so it takes longer from 80 to 100 correct getting from 80 to 100 it takes about as much time as getting from 0 to 80 oh just think of like the island got to find a parking spot oh and just like if you're in a mole and like and it's busy then uh takes longer to find a parking spot that if it's empty so essentially you're satisfied with the the technology that's available right now in terms of like the amount of mileage that you get out of it and things along those lines yeah range is not an issue um cost is is more of an issue so just need to make the car affordable a longrange car needs to be affordable when you fully roll out uh how many of those things how many cyber trucks can you guys make a month um we're aiming to make about uh 200,000 a year at volume production wow maybe a little more but uh I I just can't emphasize enough that manufacturing is much much harder than the initial design um you know you you you can not that the Cyber truck was easy to design I'm not trying to trivialize design it's just what I'm trying to do is to emphasize the difficulty of manufacturing which is not uh understood by the public m because there's no movie about it so there's lots of movies about the the sort of wild inventure in the garage um but the I'm not aware of any movie about manufacturing have you ever heard of a movie of man about manufacturing I can't remember any Jamie any movie about manufactur coming in my brain but I I don't think that's what it's even about so I have no idea what is that the Michael Keaton was making some cars in somewhere I I I was going to look it up Ian it's Tommy Boy yes the only one that's a great movie that might be the only one that's interesting that it's such an IM immense part of uh American culture and also the decline of some American cities I mean it's famously uh documented in Roger and me which is a great documentary where he just talks about how Flint got destroyed when they pulled out the car manufacturing yeah yeah um I mean there's a reason why um generally politicians are really try very hard to get a factory in their area is because it's a massive generator of jobs and for every Factory job there's like five roughly five um support jobs you know so it's like teachers electricians plumbers uh lawyers accountants what not um restaurants uh so there's so so manufacturing is kind of like a a nucleus prom which many jobs spring that's why it's uh generally you know Governors and prime ministers and presidents will try so hard to get a factory in their um country or region when you decided to build the gigafactory and what you decided Well just even when you decided to get involved with Tesla did you have any idea of how difficult this would be did you have a preconceived notion that I thought it would be very difficult I I thought our probability of success was less than 10% who yeah I mean it it would be foolish to think anything else other than that I mean the even at this point the the only car companies that have not gone bankrupt are Ford and Tesla American car companies you know General Motors went bankrupt and CH went bankrupt in 2009 um there's some chance they'll go bankrupt again uh Ford and Tesla barely made it um it was incredibly difficult to keep Tesla alive when General Motors and Chrysler were going bankrupt so um because manufacturing is the actual hard thing not that by far the hard thing I just can't emphasize that enough and I I hope somebody makes a movie about that maybe they should make a movie about Tesla sure why not yeah perfect who would you want to play you I don't care how about David Spade anyone no I don't care I'm kidding I I don't care if anyone plays me I I but I do think that I just went back to Tommy Boy yeah I we rocks um so um you know Jim Jim FY is the you CEO of Ford and he's Chris fy's cousin no way yes wow that's crazy yes that's crazy and they look I mean they look [Laughter] related yeah there uh there should be a movie yeah I just you got to get someone good that doesn't [ __ ] it up someone doesn't well I mean the thing is that writers are just disconnected from manufacturing they just never see it so right um and I guess you have to try to create some narrative a um I mean there are some shows like how it's made type of thing um but they're pretty Niche um the but I I know some of a broken record here but I can't emphasize enough how that it is insanely difficult to manufacture makes sense yeah well it particularly makes sense when there something that novel something is but ultimately cool as [ __ ] yeah um what has it been like uh you've you've owned X for a year now oh yeah do you do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and have a dream that you didn't do it and your life is infinitely easier well it's certainly um a recipe for trouble I suppose or contention um what was it It ultimately that led you to make the decision to do it I mean this is going to sound uh somewhat melodramatic but I was worried about that that it was having a corrosive effect on civilization uh that I was uh just having a bad a bad impact um and um I think part of it is that it's where it's where it was located which is uh you know downtown San Francisco um and while I I think San Francisco is a beautiful city and and we should really fight hard to um kind of write the ship of San Francisco if you've walked around downtown San Francisco right near the xfk Twitter headquarters it's a zombie apocalypse I mean it's rough have you have you been been in that area not lately no I've heard it's crazy I've heard it's crazy I've heard you you really can't believe it until you actually go there you can't believe it until you go there so now you have to say well what philosophy led to that outcome and that philosophy was being piped to Earth so um you know a philosophy that would be ordinarily quite Niche and geographically constrained so the that sort of the fallout area would be limited um was effectively given an information a weapon um Tech Information Technology weapon to propagate uh what is essentially a mind virus to the rest of both um and the outcome with that M virus is very clear if you walk around the streets of downtown San Francisco it is the end of civilization and it's not just uh propagating the Mind virus but suppressing any opposing viewpoints yes well in order for the virus to propagate it must suppress opposing both viewpoints so because it doesn't stand up to scrutiny correct yeah I mean you I mean you've you you you you've felt the the virus yeah yeah people try to cancel you so many times yeah it's fascinating yeah um I don't think you're melodramatic at all I I I think it's a it's a I mean I don't want to be melodramatic but it's almost like a death cult it's a death cult no no that is exactly right um it it it's essentially the uh extinctionist like it's in the limit it is that they're propagating uh the extinction of humanity and civilization um and and there's some people who are are like most most the time it's it's implicit they don't exp but sometimes it's explicit like there was a guy on the front page of the New York Times uh who literally has the thing called the extinctionist movement um and he was quoted on the front page of New York Times as saying uh there are 8 billion people on the world but it would be better if there were none and I'm like well buddy you can start with yourself yeah um does he have friends that's what always fascinates me well here he is that guy he looks like you not long for this Earth I mean doesn't voluntary human extinction movement that's hilarious spend I'd like to party with that dude I would just like to like that's that's that's that's the death that's that's an explicit version of the death cult yeah May and die out it's I mean it's it's not Extinction is a word he uses yes no I mean it's not a it's literally a self-description they cover was in charge of social social media yeah and still Lely is at uh Google and Facebook by the way yeah so I'm like uh I'm not in favor of uh human extinction uh they are and uh they can go to hell well that guy is yeah he can go to hell that guy seems silly I like to hang out with him though I would like to find out what makes him tick I bet that guy is fascinating this episode is brought to you by DraftKings we're more than halfway

the limit uh if you go if if you take environmentalism to an extreme you you start to view Humanity as a plague on the surface of the Earth like a like a mold or something right um and but it's this is actually false the Earth could could take probably 10 times the the current civilization the the population could be you could 10x the population without uh destroying the forest so the the the the environmental movement and I'm an environmentalist has gone too far they've gone way too far um you know if you if you saw thinking that that humans are bad then the natural conclusion is humans uh should die out now I'm headed to an AI safety International sort of AI safety conference uh later ton night leaving in about 3 hours um and um I don't meet with the British prime minister a number of other people um so you have to say like how could ai go wrong well if if if AI gets programmed by the extinctionist it will its utility function will be the extinction of humanity yeah clearly yeah yeah I mean particularly if they won't even think it's bad like that guy right yeah if you let a there's a lot of decisions that AI would make that would be very similar to Eugenics I mean there would there would be some radical changes in what people are allowed to and not allowed to do that allow them to survive that may be detrimental in terms of like pollution and things like like that but it may be the only solution they have in their area I mean maybe AI would come up with some sort of a different structure in terms of how they get power and resources but there's no shortage of power um like we talked about solar power for cars the the issue is the cars just have a very low sface area um but you you could actually power the entire United States with uh 100 miles by 100 miles of solar really yes so you can just pick some dead spot that you fly we still plenty cover that sucker up with solar panels and charge the whole country absolutely 24/7 you need batteries but yes yeah wow yeah it's not hard I mean meaning it's like it's very feasible in fact uh I mean the the the sun is a converting of over 4 million tons of Mass to energy every second and it's no maintenance that thing just works that we have a giant Fusion reactor in the sky that is the Sun in fact people like someone's like what about in a radiation I'm like the sun is literally a nuclear reactor in the sky yeah are you scared to go in daylight rocks of radiation yes the the radiation risk is greatly uh overestimated you know um I always wonder why radiation is always bad in real life but always awesome in comic books yeah exactly get by radioactive spider and suddenly you have spider abilities get hit with gamma raay I what if you radioactive cockroach it' be like the Cockroach man yeah you can be one of the X-Men yeah yeah it's a I I think the the problem is like most people just don't understand what radiation is and so it just sounds like a mysterious invisible death rate well it's almost like drugs like we think of it we put a blanket over it like it's all one thing you know radiation is Chernobyl you know right I mean the thing is you can go to you can actually tour Chernobyl right now so is you you can actually go to the m well I mean this war zone but apart from that the the issue is uh you know more getting shot than it is there's you don't have a radiation risk uh I mean but the problem is like I think when people don't understand what radiation is they they just they can't see it they can't feel it they think well I could just die at any moment like from a magic death ray right um you know I've had people say like oh the radiation from their phone is going to hurt them or they're scared of the microwave I'm like when you say radiation do you mean particles or photons and if you mean uh photons what wavelength um and they like I don't know what you mean that's they don't know anything about that right they just have they're afraid of the term but it's because of Three Mile Island and Fukushima we've been yeah but nobody died of radiation from Fukushima not one person true in fact uh but I but I was asked by people in California like when when Fukushima happened um whether the the radiation would get to California I'm like that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard and so uh actually to help support Japan I flew to Fukushima and ate locally grown vegetables on TV and I'm still alive I have a friend he's very smart but he won't eat fish out of the Pacific because he's worried about the radiation from Fukushima yeah that's that's irrational there is no physics substance to that I would say at all not even slightly I'm going send him this clip yes um go back to the sushi place bro no you you you should be if you eat too much tuna you can to have mercury yes correct mercury poisoning from tuna is a real thing you can get arsenic from sardines too I found that out the hard way really yeah ate too many sardines yeah I ate my I got my blood work done and uh the doctor says you have arsenic in your blood and uh I go someone poisoning me he goes it's very very low level it's like is your girlfriend angry at you like and I said yeah I eat like three cans of sardines a night that's a lot of sardines man I love sardines I mean yeah it's they're them I really do s I've always loved sardines okay I love them but turns out like you can't eat too much of it cuz they got they yeah they're not good for you okay yeah I mean a little sardines once in a while but not three cans a night well for me it's like I come home late from The Comedy Club but I want something easy to eat and I want I don't want to stop fast food so I open up a few cans of sardines and I'll you know watch a little TV eat a few cans of sardines doing it every night and then I stopped doing it and I got my blood worked on a couple months later it was gone yeah so well I I think anchovies really really uh pip up a Caesar salad yeah they do I'm a fan I'm aan I'm a fan of anchovies as well one of my favorite pizzas ever is pineapple and anchovy double pineapple double anchovy it's amazing it's the sweet and the salty and then you got the tomato sauce and the cheese it's my favorite pizza it's very good I mean as a kid I was like very much a G Hawaiian pizza and as an adult I like it hawaiian's good but I'm telling you anchovies pineapple is the bomb diggity that's the bomb diggity I'll give it a shot that's the bomb diggity hey wait can we order some right now is that feasible I I bet we could okay let's try it that' be sick yeah I can do we'll have someone out there have Jeff order uh a very large pizza with double pineapple double anchovies great fantastic I'm hungry [ __ ] go yes let's [ __ ] go no time like the present enjoy life well there's got to be a good spot around here tell we'll find a good spot and tell them it's for us they'll they'll cook it up if they if they won't if they won't the pizza all right tell them we we'll mention their name tell them we'll mention their name on the podcast don't tell them it's us yeah tell them it's us [ __ ] it if they're going to close tell them we we'll mention their name what is this what is this salty sauce that's so mysterious oh no right don't tell them it's us good call yeah don't tell us make sure you don't buy it from any lials what what is the salty Tangy substance don't buy it from East Austin don't buy from anyone who still wears a mask there's a lot of them out there there's a lot of them out there there're still masked up it's wild yeah once in a while I see someone paranoid I'm like on the street yeah I saw a guy on the street the other day just walking around with a mask on him like okay buddy you look like you're about 28 years old yeah I think you're going to be okay be okay yeah you're probably not going to be okay breathing that [ __ ] same air in that mask and all the bacteria spitting out yeah it's attaching to that cloth yeah it it it's it masks are not like some magic uh Health Shield um I mean there are are times where you know masks warranted like if a surgeon is operating on you or whatever then you don't want the surgeon spitting in your wound you know of course um but uh most of the time a mask is not good for you if you can breathe out of it that means you can you you're breathing in that means you're also exhaling so like how much is it filtering like what is it what it's like a I'd say like a mask is much like a sort of a shield in battle in that uh yeah you know it'll help protect you a little bit from arrows stuff but it's not doesn't make you Arrow prooof we're just talking about you know shooting arrows and stuff right there's so I mean there are times when when masks are warranted but most of the time it's it's actually counterproductive well that was one of the things about the old Twitter was the propaganda and yeah the adherence to whatever the CDC was saying and the dismissing of legitimate scientists guys like uh Jay bachara from Stanford and legit guys yes and they were suppressing them and even Banning them they banned Alex baronson I mean this is it was wild they banned Alex for essentially reading peer-reviewed papers yeah no I I mean all Twitter was basically an arm of the government yeah so was that shocking like what was that like is that to me that was the most bizarre was the Twitter files when you let shellenberger and Matt taii and all those guys get in the Twitter and the response were Matt Tai gets audited I mean which is just wild I mean it's just so blatant and so in your face yeah it's weird no I mean the yeah the the great to which and and by the way Jack didn't really know know this but the degree to which Twitter was simply um an arm of the government was not well understood by the public and uh it was there was no it was whatever the official government it was like prda basically um you know a state publication is the way to think of old Twitter it's a state publication and was the justification from their perspective that they are progressive liberals they have the right intentions it's important that they stay in power that the progressive liberals stay in government and power because this is the this is their there there was there was uh basically oppression of um any any views that would even I would say be considered middle of the road um but certainly anything on the the right I'm not talking about like like far right I'm just talking mildly right the people like Republicans were suppressed at 10 times the rate of Democrats um now that's because uh old Twitter was fundamentally controlled by the farle it was like completely controlled by the the farle and that's why I say like like San Francisco Berkeley is a niche ideology it's hard to say like is there a place that's more far left than San Francisco Berkeley maybe Portland maybe Portland but it's like it's a right there it's those two places are the the most farle places uh in America yes um so from their standpoint everything is to the right including moderates right right so now if if if you internalize a farle position uh everything seems wrong to you that if that is not farle right and so they naturally oppressed any anything that didn't agree with their views that's why I say that it was an accidental far-left information weapon so uh is because like Silicon Valley attracts the smartest Engineers the smartest sort of technologists and programmers from around the world um they created an information weapon that was then harnessed by the farle who could not themselves create the weapon but happened to be collocated where the technologists were and happened to be aligned politically with the people that possessed it the technologists are generally are moderate maybe moderate left but they they're not they're they're not farle that's why I say San Francisco Bley it's it's it doesn't even extend to South San Francisco or even to paloalto so so SF Bley is the most farle um perhaps you know in a competition with Portland but I'd say SF Bley is more farle even than Portland like literally in America it's we're talking about an area that's maybe a 10 mile radius and so the normally the the effects the negative effects of a far-left ideology that is would be geographically limited to a 10 m radius that's like not it's small like the so so any any bad effects of that ideology would be geographically constrained under normal circumstances and have been in the past but when you have uh basically a techn technological megaphone which which was Twitter and social media in general suddenly the the far left handed a megaphone to Earth a a an incredibly powerful technology weapon that they themselves could not create but they happened to be collocated with the technologists who created it by accident is it shocking that more people don't understand how dangerous that is I think some people understand um some people do some people understand um so I mean from the standpoint of of some of people who used to be a Twitter uh the people like well it's a big shift to the right that is correct it is a shift to the right because everything is to the right if you're farle everything is to the right but it's but how many farle people have actually been suspended or or banned from from Twitter now X zero so it's really just moved to the center but from the perspective of the far-left it is it's moved to the right he like Everything's Relative the the the difference in moderation sorry I should say it's it propagated that far left philosophy not just to America but to everywhere on earth right yeah yeah and with the same level suppression in other countries as well yes but the Taliban is on Twitter right like I always think of like hey Mr Taliban telling your banana [Laughter] I mean there but there's definitely some people on Twitter that are I want to go um yeah so the point the point is um I that I from my standpoint uh that is that xfk Twitter um should uh represent the sort of collective consciousness of humanity so now that that means that there going to be views on there that you don't like um or disagree with um but that's Humanity so are you going to exclude them or or not now I mean if if somebody you know breaks the law then then the account is suspended I mean if they uh ad actively Advocate murder then the account is suspended we we do have what call like the kind of United Nations exclusion rule which is that you can have say the Ayatollah who you know uh would would prefer that Israel didn't exist for example um and um but he's allowed to go to the UN building in New York um and uh in fact generally officials from Iran uh do in fact go to the UN building in New York um even though they are heavily sanctioned country so so I think that there's there's Merit to having uh just like there's mer there's some Merit to the UN one can disagree with the UN and I think one we shouldn't have a world government that we bow down to but in fact that's risky for civilization but I think you do want to have the leaders of countries uh represented um on social media you want to hear what they have to say even if you what they say is terrible but I think that is true across the board and I think one of the things you just said that's very important is that's Humanity and it's I think it's important that a a social media platform especially the biggest one represents Humanity so we understand what we're talking about because if we have this distorted idea of what people think and want and need because everyone only exists inside this ideological bubble and anything outside of that bubble gets censored yes then that changes literally changes the tone of the entire country changes what people think is okay and not okay makes people feel differently yes it's not Humanity it's different it's a a very uh forced version of humanity yes absolutely yeah so um I mean the whole point of free speech the only free speech is only relevant the first amendment is only relevant um if you allow people you don't like to say things you don't like um because if you like it you don't need a First Amendment so the whole point of free speech is that frankly even people you hate say things you hate because if they can say if people you hate can say things that that you hate that means that they can't stop you from saying what you want to say right which is very very important right but the problem with Twitter was it was not the case it was correct the it was people that you hate couldn't say anyone they didn't like they censor yeah or that what's called de amplify no well not just de amplify but under the behest of the government would suppress real news which was very bizarre yes so they were very aware of something being accurate and they still suppressed it because the government wanted them to suppress it I mean in my view there have been severe First Amendment violations by multiple govern agencies and there should be repercussions for that and is it is it do different laws apply because it's a privately owned social media company I mean what what what what laws do apply in terms of like when you're looking at it one of the arguments that the leftists would use is it's a private company they can do whatever they want yeah it's funny that when the shoes on the other foot they now say the private company can't do whatever it wants well yeah now they're upset now it's like but the the the the government itself is not allowed to censor speech um but in in my view the government de facto did censor a speech and there should at least be a case where uh that is heard by the public um because if the government um civil coerces uh you know a platform a sort of a coerces the Press um then I think that is or should be a First Amendment violation well they can't do it with other media forms right they're not allowed to do it with any other they're not they're not allow TR to do that with a newspaper that that get in trouble would they you know that's the question it's like you didn't know about F the the the federal government you didn't know about the intelligence agencies inside of Twitter until we found out like do you think that this is ubiquitous is this it's absolutely all the social media companies in fact right now X if you know for know as Twitter is the only one that that is not uh cow to the government it's the only one there isn't all the others just do exactly what the government wants that wild yes what I was getting at do you think that that's everywhere yes do you think that that's CNN do you think that that's the New York Times do you think that that's the Washington Post because if they were going to infiltrate media they going infiltrate social media the I mean it is weird the degree to which the media is in lock step like why is the media in lock step and why doesn't the media question the government they used to right why don't they do that anymore seems weird something doesn't add up what do you think well there seems like there's a bunch of factors right I think one of the big factors is pharmaceutical drug companies allowed to advertise on television and we're one of two countries in the world that allow that I actually agree with pharmaceutical advertising provider it is truthful um because there there could be some drug that is helpful to someone but obviously the claims need to be accurate um so I actually think pharmacetical advertising if it is accurate I think it actually you know play devil's advocate here I think phal ad advertising is generally accurate um I I think that's actually okay um now now I should say that that a lot of the censorship that we see is is is um is coming from indirectly from advertisers and advertising agencies um and from PR companies um who who want a particular Viewpoint pushed um or are being um driven by uh nonprofits to uh push a particular like what what will happen is there's there'll be a sort of a group of nonprofits or or or you know that that that push advertisers to advertise or not advertise on a particular platform um you one often hears of the sort of George sorus Boogeyman but I mean sorus actually you know he he is I believe the top contributor to the Democratic party um the second one was uh Sam backed so and sorus I don't know I mean he had a very difficult upbringing um and uh I in my opinion he fundamentally hates Humanity that's my opinion really yeah I mean well he's doing things that ero the fabric of civilization you know uh getting da elected who refuse to prosecute crime that's part of the problem in San Francisco and la and much of other cities so why would you do that was it human or is it just the United States as a whole Ian pushing things to other countries too same thing yeah now George at this point is pretty old I mean he's not uh you know he's basically a Beto at this point but I mean he he and he's he's he's very smart um and he's very good at Arbitrage you know famously he uh shorted the British pound that's sort of how I think he made his first money was shorting the pound um so he's good at spotting uh basically Arbitrage like spotting value for money that other people don't see so uh one of the things he noticed was that in that that the value for money in local races is much higher than it is in National races the lowest value for money is a presidential race then next lowest value for money is a senate race then a Congress and then but once you get to sort of city and state district attorneys um the value money is extremely good and Soros realized that you don't actually need to change the laws you just need to change how they're enforced if nobody chooses to enforce the law or the laws are differentially enforced it's life changing the laws that's what he that's what he figured out but is what that this trend that people haven't pulled the brakes on this and have it reverse course pulling the brakes yeah yeah pulling the brakes right now yeah you are but you might be the only one well I think more people should um most people just don't want to rock the boat um most people are looking for acceptance from society and they they're you know if there's some negative press article they're like shattered I couldn't give a damn right go ahead make my day well it's fascinating where if you're a high-profile public figure like yourself no there's no there's it's impossible to make everybody happy so there's going to be someone who says something shitty about you yeah somehow or another when it's in print does that mean more because other people going to see this shitty thing well I guess that's where it gets odd because essentially an article in the New York Times is just a single person's opinion and who whatever edor gets involved it's just a lot of people will read that I mean Le less people at least I think people know that now people the New York Times these days be hard to read well unfortunately they make some grave errors yeah like that Hamas bombing the the uh the no the Israeli bombing the hospital story yes it's delicious I mean that I think we should cut off chickf uh exports that'll that'll bring them to the knees right away what you do take a trip and dip it in nothing what we need to do is introduce them to pineapple and anchovy pizza they will have I hope that's coming that is that coming do we have a a pizza name like a company I think so I'll I'll get some information good one though Pizza Leon oh that's legit it's pretty close there we go nice did they give us a timeline uh I it shouldn't take too long they're

at night yeah my my hat is aw I mean than that is like great absolutely you know late night food I appreciate the if you can get a really good late night meal yeah hats off or wigs off upet yeah I'm I'm a giant fan of very good late night food and that's one of the things that like Los Angeles really used to have they had a Pacific Dining cart where you can get a legit steak 24 hours a day really that's great yeah I don't know if it's still open in Downtown LA I believe the one in Santa Monica closed but a Pacific Dining Car in Downtown LA was a legit Steakhouse and you get it we would leave The Comedy Store 2: 3 in the morning get a legit Stak that's cool is that still open temporarily closed ah [ __ ] Co got him Co just took out so many restaurants crazy it's not coming back website seems to be down to yeah they're not coming back [ __ ] Co got 70% of the restaurants in La at one point wow not Co I should say policies well lockdowns the Mind virus I mean it's like just crazy um I moved here one one of the reasons why I moved here is we came here in May of 2020 and you could go indoors and eat in restaurants and and my kids who were pretty young at the time 10 and 12 they were like we want to live here was like they're freaked out like La was weird I mean for most of Co I was actually in South Texas building this this uh Starship Factory um and you know we're just yeah no mask no nothing just building a factory building rockets and uh then you know that you have a team from California visit all mased up and uh theyd freak out that we not have masks and we're like we're still alive man yeah so um did you lose anybody did anybody from your factory die of Co not that I'm aware of now so so part of it is that like uh that I I kind of saw a dress rehearsal which is that you know I kind of started in Wuhan um and so Tesla's got uh 20,000 employees in in China um and so the you know the first wave OCC happened in China and we had nobody died or got seriously ill I was like okay well like this is you know can't be that bad if and and and and we're not relying on government statistics we literally know who shoot up for work you know right did they bad did they badge in or not um and we had no no one die and no one got seriously ill so I'm like well I don't know what the big deal is well there's a problem that people still want to stick to this initial narrative that they believed and that they espoused like they repeated it and so they'll still fight you on this today people will still fight you today on the merits of the lockdowns the importance of vaccine mandates closing schools there's people that stated an opinion in 2020 and they still are doing mental gymnastics to try to make it seem like that was the right choice no it was just a panic yeah um and and a lot of discs got ascribed to co that had nothing to do with Co and in fact I'd say in the beginning um The Cure is worse than the disease so uh because people panic too much and so that somebody would um get diagnosed with Co they put them on uh intubated V ventilator for a week and this was going to basically cook your lungs so if if you if you are on pure2 um under pressure with a a tube stuck down your throat um and and under anesthetic this is this is very bad for you like it's one thing if you do that for a couple hours for an operation but you do that for a week uh it's going to it's going to roast your lungs like what the air that we're breathing right now is is 78% nitrogen 1% argon about 21% oxygen and and some miscellaneous um so if you ask most people what are you breathing they say oxygen no you're breathing nitrogen um only about a fifth of it is is oxygen and there about one 1% agon um so so um now I know quite a lot about life support systems because we make spaceships and there you have to keep people alive in a vacuum so you got to say okay what percentage nitrogen what percentage oxygen you going to do what's the pressure going to be um and uh so like sea level pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch um and the partial pressure of oxygen uh at 20 being 20% is therefore roughly 3 pounds per square inch of oxygen so in in a in a spacecraft you want to and especially if you're in a space suit uh you want to lower the pressure so you want to keep the the oxygen still still give people enough oxygen to function obviously but you want to lower the nitrogen content so that you don't have a spacit that's at at 15 psi because at 15 psi you just you know just pop out like a balloon it's like hard to move ah so so you want to try to lower the pressure um you know down to around I don't know 6 seven PSI maybe even 5 PSI um so you you'd lower it to you know try to keep the oxygen partial pressure of oxygen roughly the same so maybe around 3 PSI and then 3 PSI of of nitrogen so you got 50/50 mix of nitrogen and oxygen and um and then you it's get pretty hot into that Weg yeah t out made it a while I just felt get hot to I I'm sweating it's going to be sweaty and itchy a little bit yeah can't believe people wear them all day yeah um so anyway so about keep people alive in a vacuum you know um so um you know we designed the life support system for keeping humans alive in a vacuum the vacuum of space which is very difficult um so we know quite a lot about um what it takes to keep people alive so you do want do not want to PE be people um you know 100% oxygen this actually for an extended period of time this is not good for you well 80% of the people they put on ventilators died yeah so in fact I I actually posted about that because um I I called doctors in Wuhan and said what are the biggest mistakes that you made on the first wave those were early on and they said we put far too many people on intubated ventilators so then I I actually posted on Twitter at the time and said hey uh what I'm hearing from Wuhan is that they made a big mistake in putting people uh on inated ventilators for an extended period um and that this this is actually what is damaging the lungs not covid it's the treatment is the cure is worse than the disease and they I just people yelled at me and said I'm not a doctor I'm like yeah but I do Make spaces shifts with life support systems what do you do I like that like twiddle kns like okay great yeah rock on well again it was there was this very bizarre narrative that you had to believe everything that the government was telling you you had to believe everything the CDC was telling you and that even as it time went on and we realized hey it looks like this came from a [ __ ] lab like even as time went on disputing that would get you banned it would get you kicked off of YouTube yeah I think to this day there's certain things you're not allowed to say in regards to the vaccine on YouTube as I said the the only media that is not uh does not have crazy censorship at this point is a x yeah that I'm aware of everyone else either um everything else is censored Spotify isn't that's why this can Daniel oh Daniel X's the man great I love that dude and you know I think more companies should follow suit I don't think it has to be this way unfortunately for us they're they they're in Sweden and Stockholm Sweden they have a very different perspective syndrome on all this [ __ ] yeah what wild about the nitrogen is that like that's most of the nitrogen from fertilizer we suck out of the air sorry the what do you mean most of the nitrogen for fertilizer we suck out of the air yeah yeah one one of the actually the the big um inventions in chemistry was binding nitrogen it's it nitrogen is actually fairly inert um so it's quite hard to um to actually pull nitrogen out of there and bind it into into like uh ammonia like like basically the process for creating ammonia was was actually very important the H method yeah Fritz Harbor yeah same guy who invented zeyon gas um but the it was actually very important to uh bind nitrogen from the air uh to fertilizer so um that that actually was frankly it's a life-saving invention um at scale um because you just run out of of of nitrogen um so uh like nitrogen pure nitrogen is is a low energy state so to try to bind it into fertilizer is requires light energy to do that that's quite quite tricky so that was a very important breakthrough yeah I read that 50% of the nitrogen in most people's body comes from that method um 50% of the nitrogen in most people's body that they've consumed from food oh yeah yeah because of because of that that might be true um it was a fundamental problem for um most of civilization is how do you get uh nitrogen for the plants um the limiting factor in fact even in the rain forest is like the nitrogen is is but bound nitrogen what are the when you do event eventually colonize Mars what what's the idea in terms of terraforming is it contained ecosystems that were are under domes like what what are what are you planning on doing to make it habitable well at first you would have to have a life support system um because Mars has a lowdensity atmosphere only about 1% the density of Earth and it's primarily CO2 um now over time you could you can terraform Mars terraform means make it like Earth essentially um and if you warm Mars up you will um there's a bunch of Frozen CO2 that will evaporate densify the atmosphere and um you'd actually want kind of global warming on Mars CU Mars is about 50% further away from the Sun than the Earth um so it gets about less than half the solar energy that that Earth does and it's believ at one point in time Mars had a a much different environment right uh it is it it appears highly likely that Mars had liquid oceans I'll be it a long time ago there's a lot of ice so this this Mars is um covered in ice um and now the ice is then covered in dust for the mo mostly except at the poles uh so there's there's there's a lot of ice in fact I believe if if Mars was warmed up you'd have an ocean about a mile deep on uh 40% of that of the Planet W so it's it's quite a lot of water and do we think that it was like that one point in time the evidence suggests that uh it is most likely that Mars had uh liquid water what's the prevailing theory of its demise well just over time the solar system cooled so Earth used to be much hot like it in the very early Earth was like molten rock um you know so really almost nothing could survive in the beginning we were just a bow of lava we're still mostly a w of lava um we're like cran Bret like there's a thin crust and uh and it's mush mushy Rock under super very hot mushy Rock underneath um and technically that that rock is on in a semi solid state but as soon as it gets to a low pressure like pops out of the ocean uh you have a volcano obviously with lava yeah so it's um at at at at at service ambient pressure U the we're basically covered in liquid rock are you aware a thin crust on liquid rock are you we the origin myth of the Doon tribe no there's a tribe in I believe it's a tribe in I forget what part of Africa but they believe that they came from Mars and that there was a civilization that left Mars you know many many eons ago and it's it's a really weird uh it's a really weird Theory because they know some things about Mars yeah I'm pretty sure they didn't come from M oh yeah I'm pretty sure too but I mean it's it's any spaceships if they don't have any spaceship then I'm like I don't believe it well like you do have a spaceship I'll believe it if you parked the spaceship how many thousands of years you parked a metal spaceship like if you left a cyber truck in the desert yeah how many thousands of years do you think it would be there for before it's gone if it got if it got buried in dirt we' find you'd find it even like a million years from now a million yeah wow really well you what you'd find is stainless steal so it would have to be some sort of an alloy it would it's kind of like um but iron wouldn't right yeah you you but you'd have something similar to like like fossils basically you know like the fossils they they they essentially uh discolor The Rock So event the whatever the fossil is and sometimes the fossils like an Amber or something like that that that's that where it still do survive more or less intact but I mean there's fossilized like dinosaur fossils and tree fossils um that essentially Remer mineralize right yeah yeah so You' you you'd see like a cyber truck shape in the Rock basically ah yeah but that's it you wouldn't find the actual cyber truck uh so if they did have a spaceship and it came here 30,000 years ago oh yeah yeah we're definitely find it evidence of it well not I mean if it was one spaceship maybe not but if it was a lot of them sure that is the origin myth of the Doan tribe right am I getting that right Mars specifically it's a hidden star star in the serious oh somewhere else system yeah you cannot be serious serious XM it's uh it's just very strange when people have this uh this bizarre origin myth like I wonder who was the first one to tell them they came from stars and when we eventually do I mean how bizarre imagine if you're successful we eventually do colon Mars and you're correct we Earth winds up through human folly or natural disaster getting wiped out and there's only the colony on Mars and that Colony exists for 10 20,000 years and they have their origin myth that we all came from Earth I mean ultimately that's going if if this does happen you do colonize Mars and Earth does get destroyed and if there a period of time takes place like look at the the period like at least the conventional timeline of the Great Pyramid which is 4500 years ago 5,000 years yeah so that's not that much time it's not that much time no I mean if it's nothing in the on the galactic time scale right so if we're talking 203,000 years from now on Mars and people talk about Time Square and what Earth used to be like I mean it is I think like there's some debate as like how do you say what the when did civilization start and I'd say like probably from the first writing um and and the first the first writing is only 5,500 years old yeah it's worth reading about the history of writing but only 5,500 years and then and um one has to credit basically the ancient samarians who aren't around anymore uh with the first writing are you aware though that like there's hieroglyphs that depict a history of Egypt that goes back far longer maybe even 30,000 plus years ago but archaeologists dismiss it because they think that that's mythical but non-conventional archaeologists who believe in What's called the younger drias impact Theory okay that uh somewhere around 11,800 years ago civilization was essentially all but wiped out by Common impacts um okay and that that is the reason why they keep finding these in in insanely old huge structures meal iic structures that are carved out of stone like when you go to back to like gockley teepe which is 11,600 years ago that's that's an insanely old structure that they didn't even know people were capable of building until they discovered it in the 1990s so the conventional timeline of people when you go to 11,600 years ago was just hunter gatherers but now that they have goley tape with its 3D carved uh things and have you seen Graham Hancock's a amazing series on Netflix called ancient apocalypse I know you should check it out it's amazing but it's about that it's all about that there's a lot of physical evidence of an advanced civilization from far far far longer ago than we have conventionally dated which is ancient Su which is we we put it about 6,000 years ago yeah like the first it's it's difficult to date date it with Precision but or at least to within a few hundred years but it's roughly 5,500 years like you say like what is the oldest like Stone tablet yeah um because this is you know it's if you're like an archaeologist if you were to discover something older than that you'd be very famous you know it's like like they really looked hard yeah um and 5500 years uh really is kind of the the if you say like any kind of evidence that that I've that I've seen that is actually substantial is is writing is 5,500 years old yeah in terms of writing yeah well what they believe is that there's very little of this ancient civilization other than things like the pyramids other than things like the Sphinx there's a geologist that really stuck his neck a his name is Dr Robert shock from Boston University and what he said was his theory is that there's deep water erosion all over the Temple of the Sphinx where the Sphinx was carved out of that is indicative of thousands of years of rainfall and the last time they had rainfall in the Nile Valley was around 9 ,000 BC so what he believes is because back then the the whole Nile Valley was a lush rainforest and eventually receded into desert um okay yeah so the entire that whole area like even the Sahara used to be rich rainforest and it receded into what it is now but if you go back then he believes that's when that thing was constructed and he says the physical GE the the geologists look at it and if they if he shows it to them in terms of like just shows an image of the erosion doesn't tell them where it is they'll almost all of them will say that's water erosion from thousands of years of rainfall I I think even if you say like okay even if even if you know even if you say like okay civilization is like 9,000 years old it's still nothing nothing so you know we're still talking about like a very tiny fraction of Earth's existence like Earth um the geological evidence suggest Earth is about 4 and a half billion years old um so um human civilization has been around for roughly 1 millionth of Earth's existence yeah CU just basically nothing and if even if it's 10,000 years even if it's 30,000 years ago it's still nothing what they're saying though is that Civilization is insanely fragile that's exactly and much much more fragile I think we realize yes absolutely I think we should view civilization as being fragile yeah but we don't isn't that bizar it's one of the weird things about people is that we unless the threat is in front of us it's abstract unless it's like really is the pizza here oh yeah pizza's here yeah civilization no actually one like one of my sons who sax he he has these profound observations um you know and he asked me what was La like 4,000 years ago I'm like it wasn't around and they said what will it be like in 4,000 years from now probably bar varried under Rubble I guess probably very similar to what it was like 4,000 years ago yeah exactly and radio and he asked me did they speak English 4,000 years ago I'm like nope like did they will they speak English in 4,000 years from now probably not I should point out that I never eat pizza really yeah never why not because it's not really good for you well I don't think anyone's going to accuse Pizza of being like a the healthiest thing in the world this looks awesome that does look awesome want to play yeah get in there sir grab a piece all right sick let go this is awesome and uh what's the name of this pizza P Pizza Leon Pizza Leon shout out to Pizza Leon oh yeah that really hits the spot that's legit I mean I'm no Dave pory I'm not like a a pizza analyst he'll probably I'm not going to rate it it's excellent this por really gets into pizza oh man man ever seen por no's videos where he analyzes pizza oh my God has like a whole method got a number system all right he's into the crust and the Flop and all these different things wow yeah everybody knows the rules yeah what what is everybody knows the rules one bite you only get one bite of a pizza yeah no one bite to taste it that's the rule yeah he bites into it and then just starts nding his head he's basically like a Somalia of pizza pizza Somalia okay yeah and and and is he is there like what's his favorite pizza joint cheese oh the favorite one that's the everyone wants to know that it's those cheese yeah we spent so much time on pizza and it's New Haven New Haven Connecticut really yeah for some reason the Italians that moved to New Haven Connecticut really figured Pizza out like they have insane Pizza in New Haven connec okay yeah like really like legendary I've had it there was a comedy club I used to work out there called The Joker's Wild and I had New Haven pizza and even back then it's just really good pizza well okay I don't know why though it seems like something that could be replicated exactly yeah it's not like rocket ship yeah yeah the thing is the people that are making pizza are not like to people that are making rocket ships if they were they would replicate it yeah they would go what are these guys doing let's back engineer it sure can't be that hard you know all these secret sauces and [ __ ] well [ __ ] what's in there yeah well I was hungry it's good though right mhm the combination of pineapple and in chov surprisingly good right yeah is the first pineapple and chubby Pizza they ever made there I don't see it on their menu very nobody I used to order it when I would order for delivery they' go are you sure I'm like don't you think I know what I'm doing I'm ordering it with extra now with extra AEG M this good this is good I do know why I don't eat this stuff though cuz I cannot stop that's the problem this pizza is too delicious oh so good high calorie high carbohydrate Foods once they start going down the hatch they don't want to stop cops are the devil oh are the devil remember they used to be the base of the food chain yeah the whole pyramid the full pyramid with the bottom of the food pyramid was car the food pyramid what would the Egyptians say said we're out of our [ __ ] mind what even eating yeah exactly stuff it's just that's the bizarre thing about it's like Fourth of July in your mouth like when how many human beings eat just processed food like the majority of their diet is processed food like the entire center of the supermarket is [ __ ] you really probably shouldn't eat except every now and then it's good Jamie I bet you want one I don't you seem offended no I did two of my not like favorite I don't like either of those things honestly have you tried it it's not my I feel like you should try it I understand I feel like I should this Show's all about trying it we shot an arrow at a car I'm just not going to like it and I don't want to offend Pizza Leone I like that place I would be offended it's hard to mess with pizza frankly unlike the creeps who used to run Twitter I don't care if someone has a different opinion than me I just don't like fish to be that honest with you like I I've tried it many times and I still haven't liked it yet I be the day that's going to be I'm going to be one over you like any fish not really you fish I can do crab meat yeah but I don't like the whole do you like sushi no I'm about I'm GNA Philip's I'm gonna try some of Phillips on Thursday though you're GNA try it but you don't like fish I'm like DC I'm afraid of that whole thing m i I've talked to Philip about it in detail okay I don't eat fish that often I like it yeah it's particularly good when you catch it yourself eat it fresh fresh fish really is way better way better way better yeah fish goes bad quick unlike meat yeah like meat you can like let it sit on for a while kind of marinate before you cook you don't marinate fish I think well they do they actually dry age fish okay yeah a lot of places dry age fish drye fish yeah I didn't know that I didn't I wasn't aware of that but that's actually a common practice to dry age fish for certain Sushi dishes like really Gourmet places have you ever been to Sushi by scratch is that in town yeah it's just outside of town he used to run sushi bar and then he sold it's my friend Philip Franklin Lee's a Michelin star Chef he uh used to run sushi bar in town he sold that and then he opened up Sushi by scratch but because of the uh contractual obligations he has to be like outside of the Austin proper so he's about 30 mil away it's [ __ ] fantastic if you like sushi it's like the best sushi you'll ever eat okay I mean it's really insane I I say that with you eat it and you're like Jesus Christ the best sushi of all time Sushi by scratch mhm they have ones in Miami where they have it now Chicago they got a bunch of them he's not allowed to do it in Austin no it's not in Austin proper I think once his contract is up you know he had to non-compete Austin for like three years or something I don't know how long it was but maybe eventually he'll open up one in Austin but it's about 30 minutes outside what what city is it again Cedar past yeah Cedar Creek it's out at Los Pines area yeah it's 30 minutes no big deal Su by scratch got it yeah it's a [ __ ] let me know if you want to go hook it up yeah sure yeah it's awesome it's really worth it like if you like sushi it's a mind blower it's a mindblower and it's on maass so like you sit down they bring you food that's it it looks good it's pretty [ __ ] cool you've been to mahesa in La yes theost B is is great yes that place is outstanding yeah yeah I love good sushi and it's a one of the things is amazing is how many good restaurants there are in Austin I mean for a city that's relatively small I mean the restur for capita is excellent amazing yeah and they're so good there's like so many like artists and restaurants we just found a new one that Brian Simpson told us about it's called bakalar okay it's uh this Mexican restaurant that's in town fantastic really good yeah they just opened up I think they only been open for like six weeks so shout out to them just at there the other night okay it's just there's so many good places here yeah like you can't have a bad restaurant in this town you will go under quickly the competition is strong there so much competition it's like and there's so much variety yeah all kinds lot of good restaurants in the town yeah it's amazing you know I remember uh we were hanging out at your place like way back in the day when I first moved here and you you said something very prophetic when all this was happening like Austin's about to go supernova yeah kind of did yeah it's Boom Town yeah it really is yeah legitimately yep and with uh the gigafactory I mean how many jobs have you brought into Austin from that factory alone well we're about uh 10,000 Direct is um and then I think 50,000 indirect so it's a lot that's pretty [ __ ] awesome yeah I mean there's there's only 2 million people in the great rasten area I know that's crazy um in fact the kind of limiting factor for growth is just finding enough people really yeah this is terrible for sound just have to like the subtitle chewing sounds this is my last piece subtitled drink sound people going to have to deal with it this is my last piece are you taking it away want me to you son of a [ __ ] I should you son of a [ __ ] I I certainly eating myle yeah take it away I'll keep going I'll eat the whole [ __ ] that's the problem being carbs yeah cars are awesome mhm yeah I know it's like uh I feel good though I mean this the dope mean explosion from Cars I'm happy I did it yeah I mean once in a while it's fine once in a while for me it's once in a great while but well there like like Tim Ferris has like that you know you have one whatever one meal a week or something yeah that's good yeah one meal a week I'll go with sweets I'll have a ice cream Sunday or some [ __ ] ice cream sunds are great oh they're [ __ ] amazing fuing amazing yeah I don't most people know what an ice cream sunday tastes like unless they smoke marijuana and then you're like oh this is a different thing uh it's an amazing invention whoever figured out the hot fudge and then the whipped cream on top of it what a combo incredible yeah yeah those too maybe oh yeah maybe great idea I don't know if that's Dairy Queen for sure Dairy Queen well I mean that's what's open right now what's legit it's 11:30 I know think what's that there's like that pizza restaurant that that pizza chain that's they got the best ice cream sunday that I've ever seen it's giant one out here um God I TR remember the name of the it's it's it is a it is a chain but it's not like a big chain people that are upset right now because they're listening like on the treadmill and they're hearing us chewing like these [ __ ] are going to get ice we're seeing pizza and ice cream sunday while people try to lose weight yeah sweating out oh B beos oh yeah they they they if you they've got a gigantic ice cream sunday everything they have is gigantic it's amazing yeah I worked there for a long time it's actually really good it's amazing oh bro they have that rigatoni that rigatoni with the meat sauce and oh my godos is great it's fantastic yeah and if it's very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get yeah this one crazy amount of food yeah it's it's really good yeah um I like a little photographs on the wall there's one of those down the street from our old Studio you knowland Hills remember yeah yeah yeah it's legit yeah yeah um yeah I used used good uh take my kids the one at the Grove in LA what if anything is out near SpaceX like what do you guys have out there in LA or or here out here uh we've got the stalling um terminal Factory so we um for the starlink V4 terminals we build them here we built the what's it called the well the the V version 3 Terminals and the version 3 Min there's like a or there's like we do part of part of the production or actually I should say we've done all of the production of the terminals thus far in La um and um we'll continue to do production in LA but we're also just completed a second Factory um in bastri just about 20 minutes from here and then SpaceX is where you make the launches what what part of Texas is that uh well the Starship stuff is in South Texas uh near the border just uh right on the r Grand and how did you pick that location uh I was just literally looking um at selite images um and and and uh you for for going to orbit you kind of need to you want to launch Eastward so that you can take advantage of Earth rotation to get to orbit so it's a little counterintuitive that um reaching or orbital velocity getting to orbit is about your speed parallel to the Earth's surface it's like how fast are you zooming around Earth uh it's not a like um the gravity at the at the altitude of the space station is almost the same as it is on the ground the reason the space station is actually up there is kind of the wrong terminology it's it's actually moving around the earth at 177,000 M hour so the space station um goes around the earth at roughly every 90 minutes um so so and because Earth is is is turning um and the um the speed at which it is turning um or or the way you experience velocity is is it's moving at like roughly 1,000 mes hour at the Equator so the closer you are to the Equator the more you can take advantage of Earth rotation to reach orbital velocity so you want to and so and and since it's rotating Eastward you want to be on the east coast to get um to make it easier to get to orbital velocity so so you need a section of Coast that's on the East fairly Southward that is not occupied um so like most of really almost really all of Florida except for Cape canaval um is you know wal to wall houses on the beach like there's almost no section of Florida that that every section of Florida has houses except for Cape canaval um which is a government base so one of the few spots that that wasn't occupied was the area just uh adjacent to the border with Mexico um and uh it it just wasn't super well suited to um Holiday Homes um and um there was at one point a development that was going to take place but then a hurricane came and destroyed the the entire place and and in fact rearranged the land so some of the plots were underwater so it's it's kind of a it's a it's a tough spot to um build a home and that's why it was unoccupied so we needed a piece of and it need to be US Territory because go outside the US um there are export restrictions because rocket technology is an advanced weapons technology so we can't just like you know arbitrarily go to another country um so it needed to be us land East Coast um and and fairly Southward that's fascinating that rock one of the few spots that exist like that that Rockets fall into the category of weapons technology yeah intercontinental ballistic missiles h i mean it makes sense yeah we could drop a rocket anywhere nobody can stop us wow that is crazy about the space station too yeah that's going 177,000 miles an hour yes I mean You' seen the videos of the rocket Landing right yes it's amazing very precise it's pretty [ __ ] amazing we can make land basically anywhere no or nut land yeah just I mean doesn't have to turn on this rusters to slow down what is it like to try to juggle these different things in your mind on a daily basis like what is it like to try to juggle X Tesla SpaceX all these different things at the same time it's a lot for a human brain to handle yeah I would imagine yeah my it strains my meat computer I mean do you need something like that though does your meat computer need more problem solving than the average one I mean is this something like if you only had one thing to work on do you think you would get bored or you would get distracted or you would not be satisfied like do you need these things to be so complex and have so many of them simultaneously juggling cuz you didn't pick three easy ones you picked three of the [ __ ] hardest things you could ever get into you already detailed how difficult manufacturing is Rockets duh it's it's one of the craziest things like not only that rocket science completely Innovative rockets that land like they that never happened before so you're doing that right and then you said you know what we got to save Humanity let me go spend 44 billion on Twitter man that was expensive what's it worth what's do you think it was actually worth everything yeah not for the market right I mean like for for humans yes I agree with you I mean I I really genuinely do think this and I've said this many times publically I think you did Humanity an immense service and that if that didn't happen The Narrative of this country would have gone further and further down that road to the point where people would have been scared to speak their mind and they would have scary and it changes the way people communicate at their jobs which changes the way it it just changes the way people when they they leave universities and they go to get jobs the the way they're allowed to communicate and people don't like to be on the outside they don't like to be ostracized they don't like to be kicked out of communities so people would adhere yeah they would change absolutely um people I guess are afraid of like being yeah ostra ostracized is is like fear of of being ostracized I think is the probably the big biggest issue um and then just being totally shut down yeah you know um where you have no Outlet um and you can just basically disappear except for inpost and meetings um so um yeah it was important to uh like steer H have at least one social media outlet that um wasn't canceling people what I really enjoy is uh reading the tweets I guess you still have to call them tweets read posts or whatever I I don't have a good word for it but yeah you can't say the ex's but reading the All My Exes Live in Texas reading the words or should say I enjoy reading the words of people who proclaimed that they were leaving and going over to threads yeah yeah that's what an interesting thing about momentum very difficult to start a whole new social media platform even one that initially got like what what did threads get like some crazy number of initial people signing up for it but it just dropped off within like a couple of weeks now it's a [ __ ] Ghost Town yeah it's like wild eily Qui it's wild I mean zck himself doesn't post so that's what's crazy got you got to use your own product it's interesting though cuz they're sneaking them in now in Instagram they sneak sneak a little thread in there because every now and then I'll see something think oh that's interesting and I click on it oh you [ __ ] and it opens up threads for me like you got me cuz they're you know they're integrated but I don't use Instagram it's fascinating that I'm sure you don't why would you if I bought X or Twitter whatever I wouldn't use anything else either yeah but I didn't use Instagram for for a while um I mean I I mean there was a time where I was posting on Instagram but um I found myself doing selfies and I'm like what the hell is wrong with me why am I posing with selfies to get likes this is crazy bizarre um and I'm like so then I was like you know if if if you if you post with selfies on on on Twitter that people would jump all over you you know yeah they're like that's that's true they were like what's wrong with you that's so true yeah people are like way more lenient on Instagram for some strange reason yeah it's it's like pretty pictures basically yeah so pretty pictures and a lot of [ __ ] a lot of it's there's a lot of weirdness that comes with Instagram like filters like uh I've caught grown men using filters on their pictures it's very strange you know I I I am concerned that like like say Instagram actually leads to uh more unhappiness not not less um in the sense that like it just looks like everyone's like like having a great time and is way better looking than they really are yeah and so you're like man everyone's like good-looking and having a great time and and um then you sort of compare yourself to that and like it's like damn I'm not as good-looking and I'm not I I seem to be sad a lot and you're like man uh you know I think I think it could make you kind of depressed right yeah well and also you're a grown man and you experience this you're also very intelligent you experience this imagine being a young kid Jonathan ha documented that in the codling of the American mind there's a direct correlation between the invention of social media and its ubiquitous use and self harm amongst kids particularly girls it's really bad for girls and they like around 2007 is there's this big uptick on suicide self harm depression yeah um you people can't just like make themselves be better looking with with the there like a limit so right yeah and then surgery yeah it was a big up ticking people getting their jaws reshaped and [ __ ] I mean yeah that's bad so I don't know I think um you know I think I I think like they have to say like is is Instagram a net happiness generator or or not I'm I'm not sure it is speaking of distorted images have you seen the court artists drawing of Sam bankman freed I mean it's I almost like they lost money or something what the [ __ ] happened it looks like it melted have you seen it I just saw he looks like a supermodel oh what s SPF does yes the guy who drew him whoever one of them I saw maybe there's more than one artist maybe there's more than one artist cuz some of those ones I saw were unflattering he looked like an anime superhero you're joking no no like perfect chisel jawline ridiculous he looked like he lost 30 lbs start working out look at this look at that are you kidding what the [ __ ] man look at that guy on the left that guy looks like Superman doesn't he look how hot that guy is I almost feel like it's not or something it might be I feel like someone's [ __ ] with us there's a few other pictures when I Googled like you know there's some rough pictures though it seems like someone's [ __ ] with us cuz that guy's handsome as [ __ ] cuz there's this one that's not the same no that one's terrible that's not real that's Satan's drawing but that one right there if that is real it's like come on that's that's not real this this [ __ ] that's [ __ ] because look at the what they did with the girl oh wow look at that picture there even that picture is car looks like she's melting yeah I don't know I don't I have to I mean but she's probably massively depressed I mean I bet like that's also like an artist interpretation of the energy she's giving off in court I mean she has to rat on her boyfriend and she's already pleaded guilty and you know for a lesser sentence she's going to rat him out well I mean I don't know who spf's PR team is but they uh they're doing an incredible job for real well I mean I mean the dude ripped tons of people off and stole their money and yet he he's getting basically you know backrub from the Press well don't you think that's because the amount of money that he donated yeah I don't know I don't know what the deal is it might have something to do with that I'm not that cynical I I generally don't think people are influenced by money well I don't know what he's doing but something's going on um the number of articles that I've seen where it's like you know where it's basically you know u a misunderstood yeah uh philanthropist uh it's ridiculous well your [ __ ] meter went off when he was offering money to buy in with you with Twitter correct well a large amount yeah um and I mean a lot of people you know um fell for is [ __ ] um but I mean I first of all I hadn't really heard of the guy I'm like who who is this guy and um what did he do and he's in the Bahamas H that's that's pretty sus to begin with he's very sus um like who's who's like if you're on a tropical island like your Finance organizations in Tropical Islands are generally have bad track record um and he's involved in crypto and crypto is there's a lot of the scam probability in crypto is high it's high so yeah I'm not saying it's all scams but no that I would leave that distinction for um for what are those [ __ ] nfts I think that's that's like 80% scam except for people people's legit I me gives you like digital art yeah people stuff is great um but I mean nfts the funny thing is that the nft is not even on the blockchain it's just a URL to the to the the jpeg so it's not even like it's like you should at least encode the jpeg in the blockchain cuz like if the URL if the company housing the image goes out of business you don't have the image anymore I never understood it I tried so hard I tried so hard I know I have a friend who made Millions selling an an artist I'm like okay save that money because eventually people are going to figure this out like I mean this with with art there is a fair bit of money laundering and tax voidance that that is uh so some of these things that seem inexplicable like H Biden you talk about H bence paintings I did he actually sell paintings for large sums of money immense sums of money okay it's hundreds of thousands ofll probably that that that that's that seems unlikely to be a legit transaction unlikely right unlikely yeah very the work's not bad though I got to say like for that kind of [ __ ] art it's not that bad yeah um I mean the thing is that it's it's hard to Price art right yeah because in the eye of the beholder so how can you say whether something like this is his stuff how muches that go for 225k a steel it's not bad it's not that bad that's not that bad like I mean I would buy that I wouldn't buy it for 225 but I buy it for five yeah it's not bad like look a lot of crackheads are good artists like you know you get crazy on drugs and splatter some [ __ ] around and you got a unique Vision that's not bad bad it's not bad that's not that is not bad at all how much did that one go for I so he's a he's probably a legit Meanwhile we're going to find out he had a ghost artist I mean I suspect he I mean artist think uh he he's he's not untalented um right so I mean I actually don't have any issues his lifestyle or anything there's his stuff that stuff's not bad like whatever that dog wolf thing is on the wall that's pretty dope yeah I like that what does it say underneath it can you read it I can't read it either way not bad it's not bad it's not bad have you ever heard the theory that the entire modern art movement like Jackson Pollock and the like was a a CIA scop um I mean I have heard that but I I have not heard any evidence for it I read the article a couple years ago okay at least uh modern arts a sop yeah every day I wake up was that long s but it was fascinating yeah every day yeah there's always something cat with a tin foil hat yeah when was this beginning of 2020 really a CIA SC but I mean if you can get someone to spend that kind of money on that kind of [ __ ] like the Jackson pul stuff so here it is p PR um preeminent culture War Cold War what is it okay uh the relationship between Modern Art and American diplomacy began during World War II museum Moma battle for hearts and Minds it's an interesting article so I I read the article a couple years ago I can't remember what their argument was but it's one of those things starts there like they spent money to buy paintings directly from artists the 40s theit okay even though Modern Art and American diplomacy were uh of a piece Soviet propaganda asserted that the United States was a was culturally a culturally Barren capitalist Wasteland to make the case for American cultural dynamism dynamism the state department in 1946 spent $49,000 to purchase 79 paintings directly from American modern artists and mounted them in a traveling e exhibition called advancing American art that e exhibition which made made stops in Europe and Latin America included work from artists like George O'Keefe and Jake George O'Keefe is the lady who makes vaginas right isn't that her work I don't know I think I think some of what she does yeah I think she makes like vagina like flowers and stuff I mean I think some of was pretty good but um well the Jackson po one was like how did come on Happ that that one is just wild cuz I I really think I could do that some [ __ ] have like Jackson P the CIA teamed up to win the Cold War yeah okay this I think that's the article I read because that's 2017 I don't remember but well I I I think you know OD is is very much in the eye of the beholder it's like what what does it make you how does it make you think and feel and if it makes you think and feel in a way that you like it then it's good yes absolutely yeah but it's also um a way to launder money yes um a number of these like very high price art things are um tax evasion and money laundering have you ever uh seen the documentary on the Lost Leonardo um no that's crazy that's crazy MBS purchased this okay and he purchased it for some insane amount of money it turns out it probably isn't Leonardo da Vinci not only that but the vast majority of the painting was made by a modern age woman who recreated everything okay like so she in restoring air quotes restoring she she essentially repainted the image in the style of Da Vinci okay and it's it's very sketchy because if you look at the original painting it was all [ __ ] up and missing paint and there was many layers someone had painted over it it's it's really an incredible documentary because it just shows how much [ __ ] is involved in these high dollar transactions and I think it went I think it was the most expensive painting that was ever sold I think it went for something in the neighborhood of $400 million $450 million yeah the lost lonardo a new film solved the mystery of the world's most expensive painting is the $450 million Salvatore Mundy a fake this film featuring tear tearful Copans sneering experts dodgy dealers and a secretive super yacht May finally settle the great Da Vinci controversy apparent apparently there's mult multiple layers and different styles of painting involved in it and when they do some sort of a comprehensive examination whether it's like you know I don't know what kind of imagery they're using but they're doing something when they can say like this has been painted many times and [ __ ] with it might it might have originally been one of Leonardo's students might not have been Leonardo like there's not okay a real to that that time yeah okay but whether it was it sou bees that sold it I think so yeah so so they were kind of aware that there was some Shenanigans with this piece but they also were aware that this was this was going to Ching this was three lemons this was uh they were going to hit the jackpot with this bad boy yeah and so they went through with it and yeah Chris Chris that's it the other one Christie's uh was aware of it's a fascinating document I don't know what's right I don't know what's wrong it might be real but at the very least it's been retouched mostly by this woman isn't it like 90% of the painting it's some there's some very high percentage of the painting that was actually made by this woman and they they show her she worked on it forever for years and years worked like painstakingly to retouch this piece of art which is very odd yeah that they do that cuz like wouldn't you just want it all [ __ ] up and old sure I mean that's the real piece of art yeah the real piece of art is not like some woman in 2001 yeah painting over it that's just crazy yeah um I mean I I you know I I enjoy art for the Aesthetics but but not for the name name value yeah I feel the same way yeah I enjoy art just because I just what it makes you how it makes you feel you know it's it's you know it's a cool thing I mean I mean obviously my studio is filled with it like you go outside I love art it's everywhere out there I'm just I love it have you SE oh the the woman have you seen the one the piece that she made of you this uh Melania Blackman have you seen that drawing that she did is that the weird one she it's everything it's it's she it's enormous okay she draws it and you're essentially made up of all these different characters and different things so here you can find her work of his she did one of me and she did one of Anthony Baine that I bought that's out there as well she's super talented this woman so this is her she's really hot too okay so you can find her standing next to it there it is Instagram or something Instagram Bandit oh that was right there was something that happened where Instagram did something what happened so Instagram is not only Banned Me from promoting this artwork but also shadowbanned me alt together after I posted my latest piece this is after probably you said that you wanted to fight Zucker well actually I was just Zuck fight Zuck fight is funny um because uh you know he was posting all these fight videos and then someone on Twitter at the time said um hey you should fight Zuck and I said well I'm willing to fight if he if he is um and um and then Zuck posted uh I think on Instagram or something uh name the place or something something like that effect and I was like okay how about the Vegas octagon um and then um and then uh Italy actually was willing to let us use the Coliseum so I was like well let's can't turn that down you know um and then um but then and then I was like well if it's going to be in the Coliseum you know we like I like UFC and everything but we don't have like tons of ads and and UFC branding on the Coliseum because it's a historical you know play it's a history you know it's a place of great history you don't want to just uh you know have it be like NASCAR so so then um and then Zuck Zuck pulled out you know use the pulled out method um so he pulled out he pulled out of it yeah yeah oh what was the narrative what did you hear jimie I don't remember well I'm will so he was like oh no it's got to be UFC Rules I'm like well okay we got have us rules in the Coliseum it's fine but we just don't want to have we got to respect the historical Integrity of the place you just the Coliseum just seems like the coolest place to do it that's why I mean like Gladiator you know come on and if they said it's okay yeah so he just wants it to be in the actual UFC like in Vegas so so then he said oh well you know uh like he accused me of not like not being being serious and I said look listen at the end of the day if I'll fight you any place anywhere under any rules oh Z that's what I said so so I'm you know name the he said name of the place I'm like I'm if I'm happy to fight him in a house on a mouse with a louse we like Go full Dr Seuss here now how much time I'm way bigger than him this is unfair I don't think he should fight me um because because you're so much bigger than him yeah I'm like 50% him yeah I'll just use a war I've got my panded War Rus move I just lie on him War move well you know like War Rus doesn't need martial arts training right cuz it's really big you don't want to go wrestling a warus right cuz he's going to roll on you have you ever been ever rolled with someone who's much smaller than you that does Jiu-Jitsu yes Lex yeah yeah yeah no I I did 10 years of marads um how much have you trained personally I for a decade of it well you did a lot of karate right uh I did Judo Judo Kai kin Kai karate yeah um I did some Jiu-Jitsu Taekwondo um street fighting which I was involuntary um I I I'm you know I think I'd be decent I I did martial competitions when I was a teenager really interesting so look at you George St Pierre Elon John Doner the Great Master and Lex fredman but like like Lex is a I think he's got like 20% heavier than Zuck so and I'm way bigger than Lex yeah that's why they have weight categories oh yeah yeah yeah um did you get a chance to talk to donaher at all the guy on the left that guy's F do you know his history no he's from New Zealand or something he was a professor of philosophy at Columbia okay and fell in love with jiu-jitsu okay I mean fell in love with it to the point where he was sleeping on the mats and teaching all day long he's an obsessive he is a real Kaizen disciple and oh man he is one of the most unique characters I've ever met in my life one of the most brilliant men I've ever met and he's completely dedicated to Jiu-Jitsu and he has raised through this particularly this one disciple Gordon Ryan who also lives here in Austin he's the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time there's no question and he's only 28 okay he might even be 27 or maybe he's 28 now but I mean he is universally regarded as the greatest of all time and he is John's greatest student okay and the two of them together because Gordon has insane work ethic they work 365 days a year they do not take any days off they train every day that's Gordon to the right of John with the the crazy beard he doesn't really have that hair he bleaches it but the two of them together are literally an Unstoppable combination I like Al look ripped he's pretty ripped yeah he's a combination of gigantic brilliant and insanely dedicated with the most incredible instructor that's ever existed I mean John Doner is universally regarded as the greatest jiu-jitsu instructor alive and his student is universally regarded as the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor alive yeah and it is because John is like a complete AB like a guy out of a superhero book like you wouldn't you you're not going to find another one of those a guy with a genius level IQ who's one of I mean you talk to him he's fascinating and he is obsessed with Combat Sports Warfare like th like strategy yeah brilliant guy yeah brilliant guy see I was impressed when I met him um I mean the things that like uh if I was fighting someone who I was not where I was not much bigger than them then I would be more concerned um how much time would you need to prepare I don't need any time no time at all no how's your cardio it's not it's not it that will not be a factor really yeah very I I mean what's the likelihood of this actually happening I like I'm willing to do it anytime anywhere any place any rules well I think this stating it this way might accelerate this process especially on this platform I mean I I challenge him to a duel under any circumstances a sword fight sure Jesus that's not NE pist at dawn that's not necessary I think physical hand Nerf guns at noon yeah Nerf guns at noon well you could you could slash it out in the metaverse but uh yeah in the real world I listen I it there's there's just a reason they have weight categories you know um so uh you know there's a a friend of mine who is pretty good at fighting um but she weighs she weighs about half of what I do and um and I said let me let me show you why there's weight categories on been fighting and I'm I'm going to do a move called the war and and you have to just I'm just going to lie on you I'm not going to put you in a lock or anything I'm just going to lie on you but I'm going to you know position myself such that it's hard to get off out from under me and I just going to lie Crossways on you and and you you try to get get away and you won't be able to get away you couldn't just you know like like if a horse falls on you right you can get trapped under a horse but you're not a horse what do you weigh about 2:30 yeah 2 240 yeah yeah so no no I'm not a horse but I'm saying in the limit if something's heavy enough like you know if a horse falls in you and dies you can get trapped under a horse and not be able to get yourself out right but if someone's good enough I mean I'm sure you've seen like absolute weight classes in Jiu-Jitsu where you'll get 145lb competitor who strangles a 220 lb competitor and they're both well trained because if someone is that good that's unlikely it's not unlikely it happens quite often when you get Elite competitors when you get Elite competitors like Elite black belts at the 145 155lb weight limit you'd be shocked there's a ton of videos of these guys who will strangle much larger black belts I'm not saying it's impossible it's just highly unlikely um and if if if this were not the case there would not be strict weight categories in marshs that is true that is true but the reason why they allow absolutes in Jiu-Jitsu is uh because the it is the thrill of watching these smaller people go against much larger people and sometimes they win no I I just just like um armies you know the people take note when a small army defeats a big army because it is so unusual yes not because it's normal right um you know if there's like it's like it was two against 10,000 and boy would beat those two guys up more likely what happens like if if if you're severely outnumbered uh you will lose uh almost certainly so look at the size difference between these two guys play it out well it's the end of the video this is uh Mikey musami who is another fascinating individual this guy is another Super Genius who trains every day 12 hours a day and uh he is competing against a black belt in the heavyweight division Mikey musi might weigh 145 pounds and he beats this guy guy doesn't look to be in super great shape well he's enormous yeah I mean he's enormous and he's a black belt so he's skilled I forget how Mikey wins this he catches I couldn't tell what exactly happened get it a little bit further here I think what happened here it seemed like he got penalties or something oh they pushed him out of bounds I don't know what that won on the I think they're out of bounds there yeah that's all that it was that's just out of bounds so scoot ahead see what happens what he catches him with what happened I'm not saying it's impossible it's just very unlikely by points yeah I so won by point I think you're making the point for me here yeah well in that case that guy's strangled a lot of much larger people than him um but again he's extraordinary he's a world champion he's a world champion for one which is this huge uh organization Singapore they do these events where they have all kinds of different martial arts they have MMA tie boxing yeah yeah um so you would do it under any rules sure all right let's go I like it I like the fact that you're interested in doing this it's fun um it makes it fun yeah I mean I I I could you know this this could be an exercise in hubris find out we could find out i' like the fact that zuck's interested in it too I like the fact that he uh he trained so much yeah I mean there's there aren't very many ways to actually if if you stick with the rules that you just to um like for example if you want to put somebody in an on loock you have to be able to extend their arm mhm and if you if you if somebody is strong enough that they that you cannot extend their arm then you're limited to chokes chokes and and you can you can do uh an arm lock across the groin with with both arms and legs like uh hoist Gracie did upside down and I think it was like the third UFC fight or something like that yeah he was pretty severely damaged that was in femo yeah that nor guy yeah and he did upside down um arm lock across the groin because he could not do an arm loock um you know a sort of sidebar armlock so um but after that people were like wise to that move so they're like we're not going to be allow themselves to get a armlock across the grin without you know that that was like a you know overconfidence I think um well it was exhaustion I mean they fought like tooth and nail for something like seven or eight minutes and you know hoist survived and then eventually wore the guy well when you're a big steroid Ed up guy like that too the oxygen depletion like the amount of oxygen your muscles require you gas out pretty quickly when you're that big unless you're insanely conditioned yeah but like there there's no way for him to do um you know arm lock like an a single a single arm arm lock uh he couldn't do it because single arm arm lock like if if you try to do a lock on the side so like a side control so from some like legs across your face is that what you mean no if if if you try to do do do an arm bar on the side you know one one arm across the the knee you know across the thigh like you have to be able to extend the arm your your your uh essentially your um you know triceps have to be able to exceed the strength of their bicep is where it comes down to but if you cannot exceed the strength of that bicep then you will not be able to do an an arm extension I'm not sure what I'm are you talking about like a Cura like a straight arm bar yeah oh so you're talking about like with just the arms where you just have one arm like like you if it's if it's one arm versus one arm but that's never the case it's almost always the whole body's engaged that that's I think that's it's well in Judo that's a very common hold very common line a one arm arm bar yeah one arm yeah um you know you have your one arm around the the neck mhm and and you take their arm and you extend it across oh I see what you're saying okay so like from a scarf hold so a scarf hold you would take the arm and put it over and You' push push it down with one arm yeah that's unusual though yeah that's an unusual arm bar but if one person is much stronger than another then they that one that that is that's the move yeah but it's a very fast move because you can take someone right from a throat drop them on the floor right into an arm bar yeah okay that's a very specific arm bar 10 seconds right that's a rare arm bar you never see that in MMA what you do see though is the two legs isolate the arm and then the person grabs a hold of it with a thumb up and uses all their body weight yeah yeah that's what that's what Gracie did yeah that's what most people do when they apply an arm bar yeah whether it's from the back like you know a lot of people have done that or whether it's from side control which is a little more easy because you have control of the body yeah I mean it's also just that that um you know UFC is not just Jiu-Jitsu you can punch people right that makes big difference big difference big difference huge yeah MMA uh has changed the ideas of Jiu-Jitsu because there's a lot of techniques that people do where it works well in competition when someone's like grabbing your leg when you can't just rain down punches on their face yeah there's a lot of unreal somebody's pounding in the face is pretty hard to to be chill you know especially if they're W if if if somebody's got gorilla fists in your face yes um it's not going to be a good day yeah Carlson Gracie famously had a phrase that if you take a black belt you punch him in the face he becomes a brown belt punch punch punch him again he be comes a purple belt and so on and so forth if if if I mean most people have not been punched in the face I've been punched in the face um so you know it it comes as a surprise yeah yeah it probably does come as a surprise there also like even even the UFC has a lot of limitations like you can't do 12:00 elbows you know so that's that's changing they're getting rid to do 12:00 elos finally finally I've been singing that from the top of the roof forever okay it's so nuts it's so stupid you know where it came from no it came from uh Big John McCarthy who was the original UFC referee okay and uh Pioneer of the sport he was bringing this to athletic commissions and they were allowing certain techniques but one of them they wouldn't allow was the 12 to six L because they saw those late night karate demonstrations where someone like smash bricks like that they thought someone would die if they hit him with this definitely going to sting yeah but it's not even harder than this one this one's harder because this one you can throw your body weight into it and it's a more natural movement this is an unusual movement I mean I'm sure you could train it and get it probably as hard but I think for most people for me I can tell you for sure this elbow has more power well I think any elbow in the face is going to be a big wake up Co if you've never had an ala in it [ __ ] sucks yes it [ __ ] sucks did you watch the Tyson Fury Francis andano boxing match is that the one we bet the ear off no this is the that's That's Mike Tyson of Ander Holyfield that's from the 90s yeah no this fight that took place this last weekend Francis and who was the UFC heavyweight champion he vacated the belt so he could take this fight with Tyson Fury this was his dream fight Tyson Fury who's the lineal heavyweight champion Francis inano had never had a boxing match ever in his life had zero boxing matches but he was the UFC heavyweight champion okay knocked down Tyson Fury in the third round beat him up in the eighth round most people including me thought he should have won the decision including most boxers most boxing pundits and he lost by one point on one judge's scorecard he won on one judge's scorecard another judge who should go to jail had it 9693 for Tyson Fury which is [ __ ] outrageous but Francis inana who is a a literal freak of nature I mean this guy grew up in Cameroon and was working in the sand mines when he was a child like a [ __ ] Conan movie like full on Warrior con like pushing the thing around in C he's developing his body digging in the sand all day he's supremely physically Advanced he's not just fit he's the hardest puncher ever measured in all of MMA there's a machine that we actually have outside at the gym and if you hit this thing Francis has hit it harder than any person who's ever lived yeah well look at him look can I hit it yeah we can set it up I had the record for the kick for a while okay yeah somebody a couple people beat it now but Francis punched like it's an insane it's like getting hit by a [ __ ] car sure and when he dropped Tyson Fury in the third round you see Tyson's on his back going what the [ __ ] and then he realizes like cuz he I think he yeah a sledgehammer he thought he was going to run him over because he's the boxing heavyweight champion he's like there's no way this guy could box with me he even said at the beginning of the fight it's time to go to school okay and then Francis said at the end of the fight you are a shitty professor you should watch it it's a good free show it's on ESPN plus you can still I'm pretty sure you can still get it yeah um anyway I just uh it's uh yeah I'm just excited that you're interested in doing it still sure all right didn't you [ __ ] your back up doing like sumo wrestling yeah what what what happened there uh still hurts a little bit actually I've had like four operations really from that well I had like I I mean I had like some childhood injuries uh like I said I was in some pretty severe fights as a kid like really like I was almost killed at one point so really what happen I was just in school in South Africa it's a very violent place um so um there's been many involuntary fights it's just the way it was um but anyway so I had like and I had some rugby injuries as well um I saw South South Africa won the World Cup which is cool and in rugby um so uh so so I think that that was like not a good starting position uh but then um the world champion Su wrestlers world champion s wrestler they did kind of like a demo bout for my birthday um and since it was my birthday they I guess they just they call up the birthday boy and say like hey do you want to Su my wrestle this is where like it's a similar weight differential he was 50% heavier than me so um like I don't know 360 370 lbs um and um it's I KN I knew You' take it easy on me in the first round so the only way I'm going to knock him over is is momentum so I got to basically run at him um so I did uh run at him did a judo throw knocked him over um and smashed the disc in my neck in the process oh yeah it's like it' be like running at that wall you know if you run out of wall it's kind of hurt did you have to get it fused or anything yeah oh man that's so it's like you can knock you can you you can knock over someone you can defeat someone bigger than you if willing to you know smash a disc in your neck yeah well if you know what you're doing and you're willing to smash a disc on your neck those two things so he wasn't expecting me to be a total lunatic on round one um and he defeated me obviously in round two and three because he was like oh eyes knows what to effect but um so I had like 5 minutes of glory and a decade of pain um now that you've got your your neck fuse that that creates problems with the upper and lower discs as well doesn't it over time if there's too much neck rotation it can be it can damage the how long ago was this you had this operation man I had three operations where you got it fused how long ago I had two artificial discs and I'm actually in favor of artificial discs they put the wrong wrong ones wrong disc in but then eventually the third one is like let's just fuse it um they put the wrong one in yeah twice so and how how cuz I have friends that have artificial discs I'm actually in favor of artificial discs you just need to have the right one so in in my case um the this point I know a lot about it the the C5 c c C6 right facet uh is impacting the the you know the facets are like the Outriggers you got the center core of the spine facets the Outriggers and they're shingled so they're they're like you know one on top of the other like this there's a little nerve that goes out in between the C5 C6 and and and if those if those verb come close together they they grind the Nerf um so you get the they just sort of start shearing the nerve um now um so my my my my my my C5 C6 right forcet and it it shows up clear as on like a technum scan so if you could do like a radioactive scan with tech technum uh it's very clear um where the problem is um so what should have been done was uh a simple hinge like a a you know basically to move the uh move the verterra the the the basically the C5 verterra back about maybe an eighth of an inch to sort of unload the facet and then put a simple hinge so just just rotation um but I was given a what is a called a mobc which is a more mobile disc the MC allows it not just rotation but also translation so it can move back and forth so that that then didn't solve the impacting of the C5 C6 because because it could it could slide and when it would slide forward the C5 C6 would bang and crunch the nerve and what does the normal neck do does the normal move forward in that way the the disc is like it's like a Gummy Bear basically normally so it allows rotation and translation so it's like it's like sitting on like a jell pillow that's what like one of those bosu balls that people sit on sometimes they work rber desk it's like a rubber pillow basically yeah um U so the natural disc allows for rotation and translation so um they basically put a disc that had too much mobility in and did not solve the C5 C6 no of impact so then then anyway the third time around I was like listen I just don't want to take a chance here let's just fuse it oh wow and so it just limits your Mobility no I'm fine I'm like I can look right and left it's it's okay yeah it's okay yeah I'm not like you know totally stiff necked no you don't seem like you're stiff necked at all no there was a guy who fought in the UFC named yoel Romero and uh he's a real freak too amazing athlete and he came from the uh Cuban wrestling program he was a one of one of the greatest wrestlers that's like ever competed amateur Wass he had his entire neck fused and when he runs like his neck doesn't move it's kind of freakish okay like you see him running and his neck looks like it's a stick wow and the whole body is like like moving around but the neck is just locked in place it's very bizarre to look at I mean he runs like a man whose entire neck is fused like watch him see if you can show the image of him here watch him run wow see how his neck he's in good shape oh yeah you think I mean you don't get in any better shape than this guy by the way he looks like that now and he's 46 47 years old and still competing at the highest level okay in Bellator I mean he's an unbelievable athlete and one of the most explosive guys that's ever fought in the sport just insanely powerful and fast yeah cool so you compete at the highest level with your neck fused yeah yeah yeah I'm not I'm not too worried about that Alaine Sterling who was the UFC banway champion he um got his Nick neck fused and then or not got a disc replac rather in his neck and then went on to defend his title three times still fighting at the highest level with a fake disc in his neck well I guess it'll be okay then yeah well Medical Science pretty [ __ ] incredible what they can do now you know I mean injuries that would have like you would have been [ __ ] for the rest of your life just a few decades ago yeah now you're good to go yeah so I'm excited we've kind of rekindled this Zuck versus El on fire I mean he's checking out what that's the I don't think he's checking it out yeah there no he's checking out you think so yeah buck buck buck well maybe he's suck oh him into fighting using tuns it might work yeah it I mean somehow or another you got him to agree in the first place I was stunned surely he will respond to a Tor like that yeah surely I mean how can you resist how can he resist resist yeah exactly just go let's go full School schoolyard uh torting what if there was like real um consequences on the line like what if you guys had a real bet okay sure like the moderation team from X takes over moderation of Facebook if if you win no problem it sounds good and if he wins Vice vers it a fight for civilization yeah a literal fight for civilization I mean I'll do it wow heavy true and you wouldn't even train for this no I train a little bit train a little bit Yeah like how many weeks you need I mean I I I don't have to train I could do it like tomorrow I tried going to his house actually did you really yeah cuz he lives in paloalto um and we're doing some um you know Tesla full self-driving testing so I'm like well got to pick a destination you press the button go to navigate to zuck's house yeah basically he's not far he's like a I think he's like three miles away from the Tesla Tesla California headquarters wow um but uh I don't know there's nobody there it's probably in Hawaii he was according to a spokesman he was traveling Oh yeah been wild if he was there yeah you say literally like like anytime I just thought it was funny um to go like you know I'm coming over to your house I'm gonna get you well it's even more funny when it's two of the richest guys in the world yeah yeah um so anyway you didn't uh didn't answer yeah too bad yeah too bad it's uh it's just fun it's fun and I'm I'm glad you're you're just for the fun of it I mean I think it would be well actually like Dana Dana White thinks it would be like the like the you know a really big ticket fight it would be [ __ ] huge yeah I would commentate on that yeah I mean the pro could go to charity and stuff it be yeah it' be crazy people would want to see what the hell is going on oh my God it would be [ __ ] huge yeah yeah it would be really crazy crazy like if if they close the thing yeah and Bruce Buffer is in there it's time the place would go [ __ ] bananas bananas yeah yeah let's do it does it have to be in the Coliseum would you agree no I'll do it anywhere I I literally said anywhere anytime you know where you should do any rules you know you should do it the sphere in Las Vegas the sphere is great the amazing it's amazing it's amazing yeah I was there I've only seen it on the outside but it looks the inside's even better I've seen video I haven't seen it live but I I was there on Saturday night and it was it's awesome like it's really good I think it might be the best show on earth oh yeah yeah I mean if you have visuals that uh accompany the music like if you have like someone like Roger Waters like which his show is like insanely visual something like that and sphere would be the art the art in the show that I saw on Saturday night was incredibly good I I don't know who did all the art but what was the band oh was you oh yeah yeah but but I mean I've been to YouTu concerts and you is great but but but um the sphere is really like if YouTube hadn't been there it still be great yeah you YouTube's it's like a you know like on Sunday there was a movie that was played a movie there whoow um where do you look yeah in all directions oh my God yeah are you I mean it's like actually being like in in virtual reality in fact it was such it was so wild the Saturday night one especially uh that you you you step outside after the show and like you're like why is reality so boring oh so this is a postcard from Earth Daren aros's thing oh wow and you're watching this I saw that on Sunday and it covers the whole ceiling oh my God it's really great you saw it there yeah oh my God that's a that's incredible yeah it's really good that' be the greatest movie ever I think like Saturday night the saturday night show and obviously YouTube adds to it but like I said the the sphere is really special in and of itself um I think it's probably the best show I've ever seen wow yeah I could imagine I mean it's just what an amazing venue and what an incredible idea to have the entire ceiling all screen I got to hand it to Dolan that was pretty amazing absolutely amazing I'm I'm so glad that he did that and then also the outside oh that's incredible they really play with perspective God that's it's it's round but it doesn't look round right so it'll it'll be like it'll simulate like a like a square like all sorts of shapes wow and then also the outside of it like they had the outside of it it looked like Earth it's just amazing it's really cool yeah super cool so I like these epic things that's the venue you know it's really cool that's the venue that's where it needs to go down in the sphere sure yeah that's even better than Coliseum okay yeah especially if the United States Falls that would be our Coliseum this would be our Rome Vegas will be our Rome I mean the spirit remind spot of being like a modern day Coliseum yeah yeah like a modern day version like what they do yeah with art technology currently yeah and then Vegas is like kind of rasque in the sense that when we think about like the the Hedonism of Rome its final days that's Vegas yeah yeah totally yeah perfect yeah let's go let's go are you not entertained you will [ __ ] be entertained you'll be [ __ ] you'll be [ __ ] entertained entertained no doubt um let's do it there's one point in time you were trying to get people to do a pause on AI I mean I I signed on to a letter that someone else wrote um I didn't think that people would actually pae but you thought it was probably a good idea if they did I mean I think so yeah I mean making some sort of digital super intelligence seems like it could be dangerous it certainly has a potential and certainly has the potential well when you were talking about the the what this mind virus how it was able to propagate through the the social media and being in control of social media platforms think about what that means if that same mind virus gets in control of a super intelligence and that is possible no that's what that's actually what I think the biggest danger is for AI is that if AI is implicitly programmed I don't think they can do it explicitly but implicitly programmed with values that lead to that that that have led to the destruction of downtown San Francisco and a bunch of these AI companies are in the San in either in San Francisco or in the San Francisco Bay Area then uh you could implicitly program an AI to believe that Extinction of humanity is the what it should try to do I if you take that guy who was on the front page of New York Times and you take his philosophy which is prevalent in San Francisco um the AI could could conclude like he did that there are eight where he literally says there are 8 billion people in the world it would be better if there are none and engineer that outcome yeah well especially if it doesn't need us anymore if it becomes sensient and then has the ability to make its own decisions and make a better version of itself it would find us to be nothing but a problem like we have nothing to offer anymore R yeah it is a risk so um you know and like if you query chat gbt I mean it's pretty woke you know yeah so um you people did like experiments like write a poem praising Donald Trump and they it won't but but you ask write a poem praising Joe Biden and it will yeah so I'm like you know that's a little sketchy yeah yeah well it's unfortunately it's programmed and yes it's programmed to be that way is it possible to overcome those problems is it possible that we could realize the dangers that are involved in creating this but somehow another engineer it in a way that would be ultimately beneficial to people or is that just a whim as a hope and a prayer utopian version of what could happen versus the most likely outcome if you say like what is the most likely outcome of AI I think the most likely outcome to to be specific about it is is a good outcome most likely a good outcome but it's not for sure so I think we have to be careful how we program the AI um and make sure that it is not accidentally anti-human so um yeah you know the accidentally extinctionist AI you wouldn't want that or even pruning well that that's that is kind of how it works is that these um what they call large language models but you know it's really just a big pile of numbers um and how you tune those numbers matters uh it's like it's like pruning a tree you know you could have a Mighty Oak you could be a little Bonsai or Mighty Oak so depending on how you PR it right that's what I'm saying like if it decided to prune if it decided the the the real issue perhaps yeah we we we cause problems uh or maybe it would prune places in the world that are you know o overwhelmingly polluting like third world countries maybe it would decide that they're not very necessary particularly if we use computers or AI or some sort of Robotics to do human labor and then you have these areas where human beings are doing this labor and they're polluting and you know there's all sorts of issues that come about because of that you say well we just eliminate those people we eliminate that issue and then we have 30% less garbage in the ocean and then it makes this call yeah yeah there something we should be concerned about and and I I I I actually to go oh [ __ ] I I sorry I need to go should we wrap it up yeah cuz I I have to go to the airport um I have to fly I'm flying to London yeah you explaining that yeah just um for AI safety AI safety conference in London so yeah I'm leaving in about an hour and a half what do you hope to get out of this uh conference like well I don't know um I mean I'm I'm just generally concerned about AI safety but I it's like what should we do about it [Music] um I don't know um have some some some kind of regulatory oversight of some kind it's like you can't just go build a nuclear bomb in your backyard you know that that's against the law and you'll get thrown in prison if you do that how much of a concern I think maybe more dangerous than a nuclear bomb really yes how much of a concern is it if another country develops it before us um I don't I don't know if if that the we just be concerned about AI being um anti-human that's the sort of the thing um that matters so potentially um I'm saying it's it's it's like a genie letting a genie out of a bottle you know it's sort of like a magic Genie that can make wishes come true except um usually when they tell those stories that doesn't end well for the person who let the Gen out of the bottom right do you think we're creating a life form um yeah I mean it's something that is indistinguishable from in from intelligence an intelligent life form certainly I I keep coming up against this idea I keep banging it in my head that we're some sort of an electronic caterpillar that's creating a cocoon and we don't even realize what we're doing and we're about to give birth to some technological butterfly yeah yeah well I think that's we're on the cusp of an artificial intelligence Revolution and um you know for the longest time or for a very long time uh We've the smartest creatures on Earth that's been our defining characteristic I mean I mean speaking of martial arts I mean I I don't think anyone should challenge a silver back gorilla to a fight you know um even if you're very good at wash lots that thing's going to kill you um you know it literally walks on its fists if those fists meet your face it's game over um so but so we're not we're not stronger than a gorilla we're not um we're not faster than other animals we're smarter um now what happens when there's something way smarter than us where does it go it's a good question yeah well listen go talk to those people go school them and I I hope something good comes out of it and um thank you for your time appreciate you coming in here it's been fun good to see you always good to see you thank you thanks for everything man thanks for buying Twitter too you're welcome really it means hopefully it a for good you know that is aspirationally a Force for good I think it at the very least it stopped a lot of bad yeah good all right bye everybody all right [Music]
