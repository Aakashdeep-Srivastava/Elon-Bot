May worked as a dietitian and model helping to promote code Special K cereal in fact she remains a well-known model to this very day appearing on lots of magazine covers just this year at age 69 she became the oldest person to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition Errol on the other hand worked as an engineer and property developer but he became Rich because he bought half an emerald mine for forty thousand pounds and then that Emerald mine later went on to become worth millions May and Errol divorced when Elon was nine after which Elon mostly lived with his father however because his mom was Canadian Elon was able to get Canadian citizenship and he used this to start his university studies in Canada from there he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania which is where he obtained his Bachelors then he moved on to Silicon Valley and the rest is history Elon has two full siblings his younger brother Kimball currently runs a group of restaurants and his sister Tosca runs the streaming platform passionflix which specializes in romance movies however Elon also has several step siblings you see his father remarried to a woman named Heidi bizudenhout she had a daughter named Janna from a previous relationship who Errol helped to raise and then Errol and Heidi had two daughters of their own named Ash and Alexandra here's an old photo of Elon with the three girls these days Asha keeps a fairly low profile and Alexandra is the vice president of a company called solar window but here's the really weird part Errol and Heidi ended up divorcing but then just a few years ago Errol at age 71 and his stepdaughter Janna at age 29 had a quote-unquote unexpected child together but then they had another one which means that Elon now has two other step siblings who he's also kind of an uncle to however Elon and his father Errol no longer speak to each other and Elon is on record as having called his father evil okay let's now look at elon's own relationships and children his first wife was Justine Wilson who he met while attending University in Canada they were married for eight years and had six children the first first of whom died at two months from SIDS or sudden infant death syndrome the other kids consist of a set of twins and a set of triplets all of whom were born via in vitro fertilization all five were born as biological males however one of the twins has recently come out as transgender and not only did she change her name to Vivian she also changed her last name to Wilson because she no longer wants to be associated with her father elon's second wife was the actress Tallulah Riley who is perhaps best known for her role as Angela in the HBO show Westworld Elon actually married Tallulah twice and divorced her twice but the couple did not have any children together after Tallulah he briefly dated Amber Heard and then ended up in a relationship with the Canadian musician Grimes that relationship resulted in two children mostly known for their very strange names their son born in 2018 was initially called x a dash 12. however because that violated California regulations his birth certificate ended up listing his first name as X and his middle name as a e a dash x i i three years later they also had a daughter named EXA dark sidiral who goes by the nickname y so yeah basically their kids are named X and Y but wait there's more around the same time that EXO was born musk also had a set of secret twins with a woman named Shimon zilis a fact that was only revealed this summer Siobhan works for neuralink which is yet another company owned by Elon Musk the two babies were conceived via in vitro fertilization so it's unclear exactly what the relationship between Siobhan and Elon is okay so that was a look at the family tree of Elon Musk don't forget to check out wondriam and let me know in the comments who you'd like me to make a family tree of next thanks for watching [Music] [Music]
